Easily 5 stars if it was updated to keep up with current Unreal Engine version (or at least not as old as 8 versions back). However, the content is out dated in many lectures. And there's loads potential bugs and errors. In fact in the last lecture He gets an error in the editor which he completely ignores and didn't even tell us what it was and how to fix it. In my case I use 4.26p with VS2019. I ended up with many errors on things like an Array error, or some classes don't even exist, warnings about debricated functions.. and few more. Luckily I know Blueprint so I tried to fix as much as I could but it would be great if the lecturer actually keeps this great course up to date.\n\nFinally, I really would have loved this course if the lecturer actually communicate with us and answer our questions.\n\nOverall, great course but be ready to fix a lot of problems yourself. So, rely too much on his methods as you'll find many things he does are outdated!",

I'm a game developer who has worked with Unreal Engine 4 since day 1, both as an indie developer and as an engineer at Epic Games, the creators of Unreal Engine 4! Over the years I <strong>created 70+ tutorials and samples</strong> for the Unreal Engine community!<br></p><p>Through my courses I hope to teach you some of what I learned over the years and help you get started building your very own games! I enjoy explaining concepts by going hands-on and showing by example. I’m passionate about taking seemingly difficult concepts and boiling them down into simple to follow guides. My goal is to make game development approachable to anyone who is willing to learn. </p><p>Besides teaching and writing about games, I work on games every day, which keeps me up-to-date on Unreal Engine 4, C++, and the game creation process. I learn new things every day, which I then apply to my courses. </p><p><strong>Join me on this game development adventure, and I hope to&nbsp;see you in one of my courses!</strong></p><p><br></p>",
