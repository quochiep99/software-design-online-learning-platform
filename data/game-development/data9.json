The manner of the tutorial is very engaging, fun, simple and effective, most hosts are really great. But there's a downside too in in 2020: it's a bit outdated (made with Unity 5 which is from 2015), which means some complications with deprecation as well as the authors not necessarily are up for answering every single question for years on end. But for me personally this is probably one of the best courses I've ever bought, and special big thanks to Jonathan Burgoyne for the amazing opportunity! :)",

The lack of explanation and the bugs the game has once finished isn't really that good. Luckily I'm not super-new to Unity and I have a few years experience with c# so fixing these issues isn't a challenge for me.\n\nOverall happy that I've learnt to create a tower defense game. But for beginners, not really so optimal. But hey, where else are you gonna learn to develop a tower defense game this easily?\n\nThanks for the course, looking forward to do the rest as well.",

Las explicaciones de algunas de las herramientas de Unity y la memorización de partes de código vitales hacen que al poco tiempo puedas detectar pequeños errores de sintaxis o de lógica en tu propio código. El problema viene cuando mucho del código que se escribe solo se copia y pega sin muchas veces entender como funciona o que tipo de parámetros requiere, además la versión de Unity utilizada en el curso es una versión bastante atrasada (4 años en 2020).\n\nLo recomiendo si no se tiene nada de experiencia dentro del desarrollo de software y se quiere empezar por algún lado. Los quizes y las preguntas dentro de la clase muchas veces harán más por enseñarte que el sólo repetir y copiar el código.",
