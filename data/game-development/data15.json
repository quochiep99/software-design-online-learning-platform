The best thing about it is that it covers every aspect of creation.\n\nA couple of notes: it covers how to add animations to a character (But it doesn't cover how to animate it yourself); it shows how to do retopology (But it doesn't go into the details of doing it the proper way).\n\nRegarding the notes, animation and retopology would be courses on their own. But you'll leave this course knowing about them.\n\nI highly recommend the course. In fact, I also bought it for my sister as a gift.",

There are a lot of videos to watch and concepts to understand, but Grant is a great teacher. The pace gets a bit quick toward the end and I missed a few points that cost me time later, having to go back and review videos to find out where I went wrong. Everything made sense in the end though. A create overview of the workflow required to create your own animated game assets or simply 3D models if that's your bag.",

Overall course is informational, some parts are explained carefully, learning flow is in a good shape. UV unwrapping could be a little bit more informational because of additional complexity of a subject.\n\nKinda informational, up to the point of texturing model is decent. Unity part seems like a bad joke and looking at the level of commitment and preparation it would be better to not include it at all.",

This game has helped me achieve my childhood dream of creating my first video game character. I have dabbled in Blender for years but felt I lacked the right guidance to see a character design through. Not only was the curriculum well thought out, but the encouragement from these instructors was phenomenal. The small exercises thrown in were a terrific touch and really gave the student an opportunity to explore their own method for modeling/sculpting before following the technique of a skilled mentor. Thank you for helping me to fulfill a long sought after goal!",

            "body": "I was quite disheartened when I realized that Michael Bridges wasn't teaching this course. He did an absolutely fantastic job for the GameDev.TV Beginner Blender course. At first, I was a bit unsure about Grant's instruction (I'll get to why), but, I must admit that I ended up learning quite a lot, from him, and have really grown fond of him, towards the end of this course. He does a really great job during the sculpting section of the course and I'm extremely happy with how my skills and knowledge have advanced, thanks to him and the GameDev.TV team.\n\nNow, my one major bone to pick... Please, please, PLEASE be better about encouraging good (and proper!) practices--like naming your objects and applying your transforms whenever scaling/rotating in Object Mode. Without naming objects, it can be a bit hard to follow along; and applying transforms would really cut down on a lot of problems that arise. At a point, Grant states naming objects (or not) as \"the difference between artists and game devs\". That's a bit insulting. The reality is that it's the difference between an amateur and a professional. I don't think ANYONE in the industry would be happy to have to deal with a model with parts called: Cube.001, Plane.004. So, please set a better example for students and follow good practices. It's really not that hard and really doesn't take that much extra time.\n\nSorry for the TLDR rant, but even teachers need a teaching, from time to time.",
