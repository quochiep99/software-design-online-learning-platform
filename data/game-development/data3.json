It also appears the lessons are constantly being updated and even certain mistakes or oversights that might have been done are touched upon and corrected.\n\nThere's also quite an active community in the Q&A section, making you feel that you're kind of part of a class and not on this journey alone. In this section, you can see some of the most frequent questions and even some extra tips and pieces of code from your fellow coders.\n\nThis has been a brilliant journey. The first time you press a button and your character does something on the screen, or the first time you manage to complete one of the many code challenges, you will feel so rewarded that it will serve as an incentive to push yourself forward and challenge yourself even more. Both Ben and Rick actively challenge us to try and do things before they show us how to do them and try to give us the both the tools and (more importantly) the mindset that is needed to be successfull in this type of work.\n\nHighly recommend it. I already got more courses from them and I'm excited to see what comes next!",

Both bring a lot to the course. Learned important things about myself too. Ben's programming angle is easier for me because I'm more interested in the technical side of game development. Rick's design focus is more challenging for me because it's a blank canvas: I can spend as long as I want polishing assets etc. I'm weakest in design and that's where I need more help going forward, if I want my games to be as professional as I can make them.",

I have a degree in computing from Imperial College London, and a physics diploma from the Open University.&nbsp; </p><p>I started working for myself at the age of 15, and never looked back. I explored careers as varied as being a commercial pilot, stunt-man, rock climbing instructor, and more. None of these provided a continued challenge, and stable income in the same way technology does.&nbsp; </p><p>After building and selling a home computer support business, I became an angel investor and business mentor here in Cambridge UK. I fell in love with teaching game development through one of my investments, and I now spend all of my time sharing my passion with people like you.&nbsp; </p><p>I can't wait to help you experience the fulfilment, and financial freedom, that having a deep understanding of technology brings.&nbsp; </p><p>So why not start learning to make games with me and my team now? </p><p>See you soon!&nbsp; </p><p>Ben</p>",
