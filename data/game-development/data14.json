I finished one other 2D Unity C# course prior to this one: The contrast of that instructor's performance, organisational skills, speech skills along with practical efficient simplistic but clean code is literally night and day when compared to this instructor James Doyle.\n\nJames will demonstrate: Bad habits, awkward pauses during most lectures. I sincerely feel bad for anybody with a decent headset as you'll experience a lot of loud swallowing, drinking pauses and at times confusion from the instructors own lectures as he inputs certain code, to then revisit that code and stare in silence at why something isn't working...\n\nSorry James, I liked a minimal amount of the content that's available in your course, but unfortunately for readers you'll want to adapt your own code and maybe use his lectures as a way to creatively map out for yourself how to approach something like an RPG for the future.\n\nThere's far too many bugs in the end prototype and he doesn't even fix them, instead it was up to various students to come up with ways to fix the spaghetti code.\n\nResearch shows James is literally pumping out new content that rehashes similar code, I read his other Udemy course reviews and it becomes apparent quickly that he is in this for the world wide accessible gullible students that will charge over 100$ for a course he demonstrates almost identically with other prototypes on his youtube account.\n\n1/5",

C'est rare pour moi d'avoir eu un prof qui donne plaisir à la matière, et qui prend le temps de penser aux problèmes qu'on pourrait rencontrer en tant que débutants et de nous aider à les résoudre.\n\nLes moins : Ca fait 2 fois que je recommence le cours, et ce parce que je n'ai eu de réponses à mes questions (Je try HARD !). Certains utilisateurs ont pris gentillement le temps de m'aider, de bonne volonté, mais au final les solutions proposées par ceux-ci se sont souvent avérées être des béquilles qui ont provoqués d'autres conflis plus tard dans le code. J'aurai donc aimé avoir plus d'assistance de la part du formateur.\n\nJe n'ai pas non plus compris comment consulter les remarques faites par les autres utilisateurs sur la vidéos (à certains moment il est signalé dans la barre d'avancement de la vidéo que certains ont mis des notes ?).\n\nJe suis tout de même très satisfait par le cours.",
