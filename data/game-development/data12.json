The journey is well structured and Yann has a great delivery.\n\nThe game examples build well on one and other, and you put together a solid toolbox to begin bringing your own ideas to fruition. I would definitely recommend this course",

The instructor also makes a point of showing how to access the documentation which will have long-term value as will the drag and drop shortcuts he demonstrates. I'd like the instructor to slow down and be sure to tell us what he's clicking or which keys he's pressing to get the effects he's demonstrating.",

Lot of times lecturer write many functions, which at that time does not make much sense. Only after you write the main logic it fit together, which might be quite hard to follow for rookie programmer. If you know some programming, it should be fine. The overall tempo was ok for me, I would welcome more challenges and more challenging ones.\n\nMinus 1.5 stars goes to that last game Food Fight that is not finished. Ending feels quite rushed and not polished. Lot of stuff there can be done easier and more \"ellegant\". Also sometimes Yann's jokes, \"hahahaa\"s and intros are quite annoying.",
