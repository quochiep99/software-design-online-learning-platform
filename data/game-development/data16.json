As someone that has been going through the course for the past 5 days or so, I can highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn AR. I have also noticed that Professor Dinesh responds quite quickly and frequently to those that have questions on subjects they need a better understand of or if looking online can't help them. Good luck everyone!",

There is no need to explain what button you click each time and many such trivial things during development. Rather focus on the reasoning... why you follow so and so way! (one example - you say you click on \"legacy\" while applying animation to model. But you never say why you choose that over the other types of animation)",
