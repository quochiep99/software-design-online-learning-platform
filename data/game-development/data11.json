But I feel that this course and the teacher really takes you through step by step at a good pace. I felt a lot of the time the challenges that were presented to me were things I actually could solve on my own and it felt so good every time I checked and I saw that I had understood it!\n\nSo if you want to start to learn the basics of Blueprints in Unreal I can really recommend this course!",

Very good teaching practices!\n\nCertainly one of the best courses to follow when wanting to learn Unreal Engine and gain good programming practices as well!",

I have a degree in computing from Imperial College London, and a physics diploma from the Open University.&nbsp; </p><p>I started working for myself at the age of 15, and never looked back. I explored careers as varied as being a commercial pilot, stunt-man, rock climbing instructor, and more. None of these provided a continued challenge, and stable income in the same way technology does.&nbsp; </p><p>After building and selling a home computer support business, I became an angel investor and business mentor here in Cambridge UK. I fell in love with teaching game development through one of my investments, and I now spend all of my time sharing my passion with people like you.&nbsp; </p><p>I can't wait to help you experience the fulfilment, and financial freedom, that having a deep understanding of technology brings.&nbsp; </p><p>So why not start learning to make games with me and my team now? </p><p>See you soon!&nbsp; </p><p>Ben</p>",
