Even though Rick is using 2017/2018 version of Unity and in 2020 version there are some things have changed, you can find most of the answers in the question area and Nina (Teaching Assistant) has been very helpful in answering questions. I am sure I will be back here to recap now and then. Looking forward to Rick's and Ben's 3D course now.",

Again I still found the course challenging, I even felt like throwing one time so the difficulty it's okay.\n\nLastly:\n\nThanks for this work, Rick & Ben.",

I got a lot of useful material about UI, animations, tilemaps, communication between components and classes, sprites manipulation, scriptable objects and so on. All sorts of challenges (tests, in-build micro or macro challenges) give you very important practice and right experience in writing clear and work code...And many other cool things in this course. Next step: 3D course!",

This course gave me the right tools to make my own games, the classes are short and straight to the point, and I like the teacher's sense of humor, it makes the videos entertaining.\n\nI also REALLY appreciate the fact that all the content in the videos is 100% free and they give you links to download everything. While other courses here in Udemy uses paid or \"freemium\" tools or assets, this one is free, and also they dont have any ads.\n\nI'm really happy with the course, and I have to congratulate the team who made it, because it was a great prodcut for the price I paid for it.",

It might be a little confusing for a true beginner, but if you're familiar with basic computing but not C# then it will probably be great. They throw plenty of stuff at you quickly and then reinforce it with repetition throughout the course; the pace is good and the material is useful.",

If I was a total beginner I might have felt really confused in the beginning since there was a huge jump in one of the courses (don't exactly remember when). At times I felt like the videos could have explained concepts a bit more, why something was done the way it was. Explore alternative solutions.\n\nThis however is a shallow criticism in my part since i totally understand you cannot cover EVERYTHING. And a student must take it upon themselves to explore and find extra materials. Also at times I felt like we are going too slowly :). So all in all great course, can recommend.",

None of these provided a continued challenge, and stable income in the same way technology does.&nbsp; </p><p>After building and selling a home computer support business, I became an angel investor and business mentor here in Cambridge UK.
