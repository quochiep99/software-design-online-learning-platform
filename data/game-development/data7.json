This course is perfect for those wanting a basic overview of what Unreal Engine 4 really is, and of course the Demo platformer game is really satisfactory after all the concepts being learnt. All his lectures are pretty straightforward and easy to understand, there are no uses of fancy vocabulary, no manner of difficult grammar usage, perfect for anyone practically. The most impressive thing about David Nixon's explanation is that he goes on to give a clear understanding and clarity of even the tiniest of things (like importing files by dragging it from another folder to UE4 content browser or exporting audio files in Audacity) that may seem trivial to some but in actuality it's helping a lot of people!\n\nBased on my experience and learning patterns from David's lectures, I will definitely rate this course a 10/10 !",

You need to have a Definitive Line to say Pay Attention this is not for You to work this is for you to learn, and then implement a this is where we put what you learned to work. their is some content that is redundant and some content that you cover far to quickly that is important. yes that is the benifit of a pause button But some pauses between actions insted of buzzing through them makes you feel a little less rushed and allows for you to soak in what your doing instead of trying to rush and imitate the process so you don't have to keep pausing th evideo every 10 seconds.
