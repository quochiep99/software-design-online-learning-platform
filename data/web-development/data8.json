It has everything you need to get started in the web developer world.\n\nI do think it needs a basic CRUD web application to add to a Junior portfolio but I think this is one of best Andrei courses.\n\nFor beginners to programming it can be overwhelming, I recommend re-watching the sections 1 to 18 until you are 100% confident before moving one.\n\nUpdate January 9th, 2021: The code and some practices are getting a little old BUT the course keeps getting updated. For example, the code for the projects are still using classes but there is a new Hooks section.",
