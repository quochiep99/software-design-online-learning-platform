And after the course I feel I can make a simple Django project of my own, but of course I am not confident in Django.\n\nBut I would like there would be more explanations in the Social Media Site Clone Project not just retyping the code, but make the detail explanation of each method and concept with a link to documentation for self studying. Some questions about the course content remained unanswered.\n\nAlso, I wish the course contained more Home Work especially in the Django section of the course and It would be great if Jose update the course. The course was created in 2017 and some methods and concepts are obsolete in it.\n\nI recommend the course for studying the basic concept of the web development with the Django framework",

Combine that with the fact that he's using a much older version of Django and it's difficult to follow along.\n\nOn the plus side, if it were up to date, it's a very thorough course with detailed explanations and all the code is downloadable.\n\nIf the teacher updates it to Django 3, I'd certainly take it again.",
