It's incredibly thorough and easy to follow, with amazing visual representations of processes that, up until this point, I was having trouble grasping. Jonas' organized, visual approach really helped me to wrap my head around JavaScript once and for all. So much appreciation for his knowledge, dedication, and consistent improvement.",

I cannot see how you could possibly go wrong choosing this course. It has been by far the most helpful Javascript course I have seen so far in my two yrs of learning the language. I wish there were courses about other topics such as mysql and node.js made by this guy because he is truly a great teacher. Would recommend to anyone",

With such a professional structured course anyone can make his/her way into business as soon as finishing this course.

I have been using JavaScript without really knowing it so like using stack overflow and site's like it, but that has limited me in what i can do so i thought i would take this course and i have to say it has spark a new love for JavaScript. In short i love this course, and the instructor is exceptional, i would really recommended this course to anyone interested in learning and delving deep into JavaScript.",

I found some parts of the Fundamentals and Array sections just a bit boring since many of the content was very familiar but I still enjoyed these sections because they filled many knowledge gaps I had.\n\nI changed my opinion about pure javascript (vanilla, as people call it), it's amazing what one can develop using plain javascript, HTML and css. I strongly feel now that I should start a node Node course or an Advanced javascript course next, but I would also like to develop a similar understanding on css and HTML.",
