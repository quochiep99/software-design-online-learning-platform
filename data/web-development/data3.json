A lot of things you’ve mentioned really resonate with the teachings in Christianity especially the discipline and not dwell on what others have to say. We often judge ourselves and others so much we forget who we are, in reality we are nobody and in my Christian faith which I’ve found 2 years ago after perineal bad experiences, if we stop judging and playing God, all we have left is Love. With faith and understanding we can accomplish all things. Let’s stay out of our heads and into seeking and learning, with understanding we will prevail.",
