So you're going to dive into React and Redux and understand every step that you do. Stephen is explaining all the behind the scenes stuff. The projects are really cool, they have a lot of functionalities that you need to be able later to build Web Apps on your own. I highly recommend taking this course if you want to learn \"React and Redux\" the proper way.",

Stephen is one of the best online instructors I've come across.\n\nPros:\n\nThe comments section appears to be actively maintained.\n\nHe tells you what you're going to do, tells you how to do it, and recaps what you've done at the end of each section.\n\nHe explains everything thoroughly so that you will actually\n\nunderstand the cause and effect relationships in your react/redux project - this is real teaching.\n\nI finally feel comfortable with Redux thanks to this course.\n\nCons:\n\nAlthough there is a very informative section on hooks, lot of the material uses classes instead of hooks. However, if your goal is to actually understand how react and redux work together, then this course absolutely gives you that.\n\nYou can easily switch out the classes for hooks on your own based on what he teaches you about them.\n\nThanks Stephen & Bobby!",
