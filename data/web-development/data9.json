I like how he makes the effort to dive deep into the Vue.js concepts and doesn't just 'touch the surface', like some other courses do here on Udemy.\n\nThat being said, one suggestion for possible future additions would be to add a section on testing in Vue.js, which I think is a very important part of development.\n\nA mention of some of vue-cli plugins like PWA and Typescript wouldn't hurt either... ?",

In short investing in this Vue 3 course is no brainer: it is absolutely worth it.\n\nThe missing points to 5-stars, are actually intended to pressure Max and get more of him... You see, I personally think one of the pillars of Vue 3 is TypeScript -among the Composition API and the use of Hooks- and for that, I consider this \"Complete Guide\" is not actually complete and I'm looking forward to very soon having to correct my rating Max!",

So if you want to build your own big and professionnal Vue Apps, take THIS course. It is the best Vue course out there. It is perfect.

        "briefIntroduction": "<p><strong>Experience as (Web) Developer</strong><br></p><p>Starting out at the age of 13 I never stopped learning new programming skills and languages. Early I started creating websites for friends and just for fun as well. Besides web development I also explored Python and other non-web-only&nbsp;languages.&nbsp;This passion has since lasted and lead to my decision of working as a freelance web developer and consultant. The success and fun I have in this job is immense and really keeps that passion burningly alive.</p><p>Starting web development on&nbsp;the backend (PHP with Laravel, NodeJS, Python) I also became more and more of a frontend developer using modern frameworks like React, Angular or VueJS 2 in a lot of projects. I&nbsp;love both worlds nowadays!</p><p>As a self-taught developer I had the chance to broaden my horizon by studying Business Administration where I hold a Master's degree. That enabled me to work in a major strategy consultancy as well as a bank. While learning, that I enjoy development more than these fields, the time in this sector greatly improved my overall experience and skills.</p><p><strong>Experience as Instructor</strong></p><p>As a self-taught professional I really know the hard parts and the difficult topics when learning new or improving on already-known languages. This background and experience enables me to focus on the most relevant key concepts and topics. My track record of many 5-star rated courses, more than 700,000 students on Udemy as well as a successful YouTube channel is the best proof for that.</p><p>Whether working as development instructor or teaching Business Administration I always received great feedback. The most rewarding experience is to see how people find new, better jobs, build awesome web applications, acquire amazing projects or simply enjoy their hobby with the help of my content.</p><p>Together with Manuel Lorenz, I founded Academind to offer the best possible learning experience to our more than 800,000 students.</p>",
