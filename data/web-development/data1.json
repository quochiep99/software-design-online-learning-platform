            "body": "Learning with Colt is like being taught by a best friend. Often times I found myself laughing along with Colt, his friendly jokes and witty, sometimes corny off the cuff remarks, are kind of a medicine to ease the difficulty of the material. By the end of the course I felt like I somehow knew his pets and chickens. But it isn't just humor that I enjoyed in taking this course. Colt's pedagogic skill is immense. A hallmark of an amazing teacher is the ability to break down concepts into their fundamental basics, so that they are easy to understand, and Colt does this with every single piece of web development technology. You will not find a more concise, clear, and complete explanation of how to write Javascript than in this course. When it comes to exercises, and the Yelp Camp project, once again, Colt's friendly candidness pulls back the curtain of web development: Instead of appearing as a super-human programmer through creative editing, he shows his students his mistakes in real time, this honesty makes him relatable and gives confidence to a beginner. It was bolstering to me as a student to see how development really takes place, mistakes and all. The honest manner in which he teaches makes becoming proficient in these technologies feel attainable, and by the end of the course, you see that it is attainable; this alone is a great gift to the learner. It's a bittersweet feeling to have completed the bootcamp, I am happy to have learned so much and acquired these skills, but I will miss taking such an enjoyable course daily.",

I genuinely feel confident that i can create something really cool even though theres a lot of things i still need to learn: i know how to find the answers and implement them into a tangible solution.\n\nColt is a great teacher and for me the best part about his style is that he never pretends to know something he doesn't. Instead, he shows himself going through the docs and stumbling around making mistakes (i'm kinda suspicious he does it on purpose but he fooled me!) and then finding the solutions so even after finishing the course you're well setup to go discover other tools, libraries, APIs whatever you might need for your next project.",

At no point was I ever bored. His way of teaching really generates interest and kept me motivated to be consistent and complete the course. 60 hours of content might seem intimidating but I was able to glide through the course comfortably over 5 months.\n\nThe projects in this course are really good and reinforce our programming concepts. They are definitely worth adding on your resume.\n\nBy the end of this course you may not be the perfect developer but it will definitely give you the confidence to build your own apps and explore on your own!\n\nAll the Best!",

            "body": "EDIT: Colt's updated course is excellent, Colt's ability to teach has improved greatly since his first iteration of this course(he was already great), and in my original review I was unaware the commonality of outdated content on udemy. I am a few days from finishing this updated course and I will give a more detailed review upon completion.\n\nORIGINAL:\n\nI want to start by saying I have diligently finished this course and\n\nbelieve you should absolutely not use this course, you most likely shouldn’t use any courses from Colt Steele, he has many courses and likely most are as out of date as this. If you are considering a course other then this I suggest you use it. I dedicated 4-5 months of my life slogging through this not updated, riddled with errors course. I cannot get this time back. I started taking this course in May 2020 and I believe that this course covers none of the major updates to JavaScript since 2015 specifically the ES6 update. No discussion of async await, promises, and arrow functions. It still teaches half the projects in bootstrap 3, has not been updated for any of the framework changes since possibly 2015 as well. Promises a from scratch authentication unit and then instead just says pysche and links a weak YouTube video from some random tech conference about it. Instead of updating with major updates they have used a patchwork type system from a teaching assistant much less skilled(in teaching) then Colt named Ian to try to patch back together the major holes in this course using notes at the beginning of chapters to bandage a plethora of errors and out of date syntax as well as completely unsatisfactory youtube videos from Ian in which he starts talking about ES6 updates like you should have heard about them.\n\nWhen I purchased this course it stated it had been updated the month I started taking it, this only means a note was added by Ian to cover some error or update in the course that month. This course should have been taken down and refactored at least 3 years ago. Instead it was unethically sold as an up to date course and I lost valuable time realising it was not. I'm not upset about the cost, I am upset about the time wasted studying an outdated course, the amount of time wasted learning outdated callbacks when I could have learned async await and promises. The amount of time trying to figure out deprecation warnings from frameworks. You should have taken this course down literally 3 years ago and that is on you colt.\n\nI tried to keep my calm and I wanted to give this a 4 star review, specifically because 2015 colt was a pleasure to learn from, instead colt abandoned this project and left it to rot and collect flies and money, looks like a lot of money.",

        {
            "body": "Not as good as expected. Some of the materials are old and you get a feeling you´ll have to update yourself. The course needs a revamp to make it a 2020 course.\n\nThere are a lot of intermediate comments made by Colt´s assistant Ian that try to help but reflect the fact the course needs to be reviewed. I know that is a lot of work, but that would get you 5 star reviews.\n\nOn the other hand I feel disappointed with the fact that in the end, I wasn´t thought how to create my own website. The deployment part speaks briefly about how to deploy a project in Heroku. Nothing is said about what about if I already have my own website. Or if I want to create a new one. I wanted to learn coding to improve my business website. I have it in wordpress. I'm aware the backend language is php and I can use a control panel to manage it. Nothing in the course is said about this.\n\nSome of the contents are disconnected. At some point you'll be sent to Ian's youtube videos, then comes Ellie to speak about javascript more advanced issues, not announced.\n\nI got to the end and the YelpCamp project that was core to our learning through experience was incomplete. They give you a number of videos from youtube to try and give you the essentials. I only watched one by Ian on google maps, and it was so old I couldn´t follow wit the current Google API environment.\n\nThe promise I was given when I bought the course wasn´t delivered. This is not enough for me to create my own website or project.\n\nAll this said I also need to leave some comments of the positives of this course. First of all the Q&A team. I've asked a couple of things and responses were quick and helpful. On online environment that is very welcome.\n\nThe course is thorough. I think I now have the tools to go deeper into the different technologies and languages if I want.\n\nColt is very clear in his expositions. Some times speaks to quick for a foreigner like myself, but we have the magic of rewind to hear as many times as we wish.\n\nWith all considered this is probably, still one of the best and more complete courses online available on the subject. I feel tempted to search for others though.\n\nThere are many other positive aspects I haven´t focused on. All in all I think 3 stars is the rate applicable at this point in time.\n\nColt and team, please think about updating the materials, or even creating a new whole course.",
