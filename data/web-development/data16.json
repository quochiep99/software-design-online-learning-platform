Yeah a JavaScript course without a mention of closures.\n\nNo word about apply, bind or call functions.\n\nHe used filter function late in lecture 98 in a wrong manner which just by luck worked for the example he was working on. So cannot even expect the explanation there.\n\nIncomplete coverage of the the spread operator.\n\nFor...of loop (without any introduction) was used for the first time in the lecture on sets in section 10.\n\nIn the last section, he just tells to download the webpack+babel setup from his GitHub profile without explaining how he created it.\n\nThe list is too long.",

It's a good feeling to see the results of some cool projects that you finished coding. Some other cool gems in this course are the use of CSS frameworks like Materialize, Skeleton, and Bootswatch, when putting together the UI for the projects. The weather app project needs to be updated since the Weather Underground api is no more. The OpenWeather api website/docs aren't as easy to navigate as others, and can be confusing for complete beginners. Brad's a great teacher especially for beginners that have no experience whatsoever. His YouTube channel is an EXCELLENT resource/supplement as well. I like how in many of his videos he explains the simplest of things because they are things that true beginners with no experience would have known. Overall, a great course for learning and putting into practice some JavaScript.",

Another good part for me is Brad's courses are very straightforward, no waste the time, no accent. I will continue to learn his other courses.",
