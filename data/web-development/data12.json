Took a lot from it.\n\nIt has 3 nice responsive projects, lots of tips, good practices plus I really liked how Jonas explained core concepts (especially grid section).\n\nFew side notes:\n\n1. Keep in mind that this course is not for absolute beginners. You should at least know box model and be familiar with display and position properties. YT will help you with that :)\n\n2. Jonas doesn't respond personally in Q&A section. At the moment of writing this review there is only one TA and sadly there were quite a few questions here and there without answers. If you'll stuck and no one will help you - be prepared to use Google/other resources (which you should do anyway).",

He is really good and taking his course always ensures that we become best in the subject. Looking forward to more newer courses in future from Jonas.",
