            "body": "I teeter between a 3.5 and 4. Mosh was very engaging. He did a great job presenting while keeping the information useful. There were niche items mentioned that are valuable despite not being used frequently. The problem I had with this course is that it's using VS2013. Taking the course in 2020 meant that I had to web search the modern way to do so many things. This greatly increased the 7.5 hours of the course. I would still recommend it, but with the caveat that you either use VS2013 or prepare for a lot of due diligence.",

However, in many lectures I feel that the instructor is rushing through the topic. I think the course would be perfect if he can slow down a little and give more thorough explanation. Being concise and not not wasting time in unnecessary details is good but not at the expense of providing good explanation.",
