Excelentes explicaciones con aplicaciones diversas. Sólo sería conveniente mover parte del material antiguo a otro curso para que no fuera necesario verlo/saltarlo",

            "body": "I completed the course except for the legacy parts. This was my first React + Redux course, so I can't compare this to others, but as proven by many other reviews, this was an amazing course. All aspects of react and redux were explained so well I was able to understand the fundamental ideas and advanced knowledge. Also, throughout the course, we built around 10 projects, in which we focused on the react and redux part, not on stylings, which I loved it since we had enough time to discuss all details of react and redux. Thanks so much Stephen and please keep updating the course with the newest content, so that it can be the one top of the React course on Udemy.",

If you can only learn one course on ReactJS, look no far, this is it! Stephen is also the best instructor on web development (actually on computer science, I'd say). The course is super organized. And the pace of the course is very comfortable. You can follow him step by step with no problem. I'll purchase more courses from Stephen for sure! 100000/100 Recommend!!!",

The lessons are pragmatic, yet layered with theory and real-world experience; he explains both the right and wrong way of doing things and hammers it in with repetition. It really includes everything, even free-tier hosting to help get your portfolio started. Highly recommended, I look forward to Stephen's other classes!",

            "body": "This course contains really detailed clarification of different React concepts. Moreover, the explanations provided by Stephen contain bonus content gained from his experience. I would only criticize the repetitiveness of few topics which were mentioned throughout the course. Although some of them were focused on different versions of the same library, a few of them were simply repeated too many times for the same version of a given library (at least too many times in my opinion). But overall, an amazing course!",
