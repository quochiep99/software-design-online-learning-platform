The teacher has a big knowledge about JS and helped a lot, helped me to understand the subjects I mentioned above, because of his beautiful way of explaining things. He sounds very confident and clear, and with just a little amount of focus when listening to him, You can understand each topic nicely. I recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners.",

Being JavaScript my first programming language to learn it was challeging but also fun going in depth into the concepts of object oriented programming. For me the content of the course was dense, but being able to understand it finally was satisfying. The teacher is often repeating the same thing using different phrasing, which might help to double check if someting is clear, but for me sometimes it was a little confusing.",

If you already know the basics, it will take you to a completely different level, even if you think you know javascript well.\n\nThank you!",

If I had taken this course sooner. I would have saved myself \"weeks\", literal \"weeks\" worth of time at work (I am a full time web developer coding primarily in JS for a little over the past year) because the concepts discussed in this course are fundamental to debugging (production) code! I'm excited for the rest of this course.\n\nUPDATE: Halfway through the course, it's important to run some of the code in the console to see the differences in how JS works now as compared to when Anthony taught the course. Such a gem of a course, I love how it's focused on the bare bones of how JS works under the hood! Every serious JS programmer should attempt to learn the concepts in this course. Love it!",

        "briefIntroduction": "<p style=\"\"> Newly married in Cleveland Ohio, Tony is primarily focused these days on trying to be a good husband. While inexperienced at that, he's quite experienced in all things web. </p> <p style=\"\"> Tony has been programming since he was 12 years old, and got into web sites and web application development at 16. After graduating with a Computer Science degree from Case Western Reserve University, Tony continued with that interest as a Microsoft certified software application developer and architect, database designer, and user interface designer. </p> <p style=\"\"> His experience has ranged across technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, ASP .NET MVC, JavaScript, jQuery, KnockoutJS, AngularJS, NodeJS, LESS, Bootstrap, SQL, Entity Framework and more. </p> <p style=\"\"> He believes strongly that deeply understanding any topic allows you to properly learn it and, even more importantly in a real-world environment, quickly overcome problems. </p> <p style=\"\"> He also has a deep interest in human nature and behavior, and how that impacts human-computer interaction. This interest translated into extending his career into user experience design and usability research. </p> <p style=\"\"> Another link in the chain is his 25 years of experience in public speaking and teaching, both in front of large groups and as a one-on-one private instructor. </p> <p style=\"\"> Putting all these pieces together, he has spent his career listening to a client need, designing a database and software to meet that need, building it, testing it, teaching others how to use it, then improving user experience by watching people actually use it and adjusting accordingly. </p> <p style=\"\"> Tony loves teaching every aspect of what he does, and even more loves teaching in a way that imparts understanding, as opposed to just examples intended to be parroted. He loves that moment when a student 'gets it', and that's what he wants for you when you take one of his courses. </p> <p style=\"\"> He has found that those that learn purely by example, and not by understanding, end up much more limited than they need to be. </p> <p style=\"\"> \"Examples need to be built on top of context, and once you have context, you can not only copy the examples you find, but adjust and improve upon them.\" </p> <p style=\"\"> <strong style=\"\"> He firmly believes that everyone has the ability to develop software, if they are just taught properly. Including you.</strong> </p> <p style=\"\"> <em style=\"\"> \"It is my pleasure and privilege to teach you. I hope you'll come away knowing something you didn't before, understanding at a level deeper than before, and feeling positive that you can accomplish what you've set out to accomplish.
