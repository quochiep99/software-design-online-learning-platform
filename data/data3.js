I'm the <strong>lead instructor</strong> at the London App Brewery, London's leading <strong>Programming Bootcamp</strong>. I've helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and change their lives by becoming a developer. I've been invited by companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google to teach their employees.</p><p>My first foray into programming was when I was just 12 years old, wanting to build my own Space Invader game. Since then, I've made <strong>hundred of websites, apps and games</strong>. But most importantly, I realised that my <strong>greatest passion</strong> is teaching. </p><p>I spend most of my time researching how to make <strong>learning to code fun</strong> and make <strong>hard concepts easy to understand</strong>. I apply everything I discover into my bootcamp courses. In my courses, you'll find lots of geeky humour but also lots of <strong>explanations and animations</strong> to make sure everything is easy to understand. </p><p><strong>I'll be there for you every step of the way.</strong></p>"
