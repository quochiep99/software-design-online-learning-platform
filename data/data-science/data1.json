Absolutely must for beginners.\n\n2 areas which I felt should have been included\n\n1. The mathematical concepts behind each of the models. While Kirill and Hadelin have touched upon those but detailed explanation would have enhanced the value further.\n\n2. Some real life case studies for each of the models.\n\nBoth of the above would have made the course a little more longer but could have transformed this course into a PG diploma equivalent.",

            "body": "Hadelin's speech style (frequent hard pauses after every few words) makes it very difficult to focus on and absorb the content. His excessive and needless repetition of words/terms/concepts makes the narration unnecessarily bulky and quite distracting. The delivery needs to be more crisp, concise, and easy flowing.\n\nMore importantly, in many cases, this narrator simply brushes aside the difference between a prediction and an actual value, and calls any model output as good without much, if any, substantiation!\n\nOn the good side, the course provides just enough sample code to get going and practicing the algorithm on larger, real-life datasets. Both presenters are energetic and seem adequately knowledgeable to deliver the content. I hope that Hadelin adjusts his speech style to make the course more engaging and enjoyable.",

Having completed the earlier R Programming courses from Kirill Eremenko, I obtained a fairly basic handle on the core R language (having no experience beforehand), and felt ML would be a good next challenge. I committed to complete the entire course - which is quite comprehensive - and I'm quite glad I did as I now feel as if I have enough of a handle on building up these models and can at least speak intelligently about them. The coding skills of Hadelin de Ponteves are quite impressive and there were many little tricks and takeaways that can be applied elsewhere in your work. I do have one important complaint and that is regarding working with the H2o platform in the ANN lecture. There are many, many complaints on this topic which have not been addressed by the author(s). I came to the solution after much research and it involves installing a compatible version of Java JDK on your machine. The documentation is found on the H2o website. As of today, H2o does not support the most recent version of Java (15) so you will need to download an earlier version from the Java archive. Installing/uninstalling is a bit of a pain, but good luck.",
