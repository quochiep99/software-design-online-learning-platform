I would have spent more time on basic mathematical background (e.g. - matrix multiplication, some other pillars in linear algebra, etc...)\n\n2. The time it takes to exercise is at least twice, more likely thrice or even more the time it takes to just play the lectures. It could be useful if you ask for users feedback for the time it takes them to exercise each lecture, and then provide some data for the average (e.g. - the course is 14 hours, most users who exercise all parts, complete it in 55 hours (or, whatever the average is)",
