            "body": "The coverage of ML theory was very shallow. The recommended companion book for the course is ISLR. I purchased a course so that I could receive multimedia instruction, which should be the best method to learn from. However, you end up being directed to many third party websites or books if you want any depth of understanding. Most of the ML part of the course is simply learning what to type into a Jupyter Notebook in order to get a very basic ML algorithm to run. The Big Data and Spark w/ Python section is a complete disaster. As far as I could ascertain, there was no attempt to show how to tie Spark into an ML project. I came away not even knowing how to utilize Spark for an ML project. Also that section is outdated, and once again you are directed to another website for \"up-to-date\" instructions on how to install Spark on AWS. Unfortunately, those instructions were outdated too. I couldn't even get Spark to run the action methods on my AWS E2C service. It was a complete waste of time. Overall, the course is just ok. The instructor seems knowledgeable, and very courteous. Nevertheless, I am leaving an honestly review in hopes that he sees what to improve, and so that others honestly know what to expect. It is not a waste of time or money, but I was expecting more. The instructor's Python Boot Camp course was awesome, and that is what set the expectation for me. Unfortunately, this course did not live up to expectations.",

I feel that Jose is one of the only people that is teaching these subjects in a fairly fast way that is understandable. I enjoyed the course and I feel that it educated me. The only thing that I would improve is to add a few lectures about some common topics that the course didn't address like how to pick a machine learning algorithm, how to choose the variables for the models and how to explore the data. I mean, all of this was mentioned in few words throughout the course but I feel that these topic should have a bit more emphasis and some explanations around, at least some rules of thumb or general thinking direction and not just 'I always like to do this check when I start exploring the data'\n\nOverall a good course and I feel that it was worth the money.",

The approach to machine learning section is gradual as well, providing the necessary theoretichal tool to study and go deep into the math beyond the algorithm and the lybraries explained. The course mantains an application-focused and practical approch, consenting to immediately understand how to apply the presented tools. The final projects at each session allow to immediatly practice and test yourself, also providing the opportunity to build a small personal portfolio. It definitly worth the price I paid, for both the quality of the contents and the supporting service. Definitely reccommended to beginner and intermediate Python users who want to learn Machine Learning. This course will not automatically convert you into a Data Scientist. However, it definitly helps to construct solid practical basis to start from to become a Data Scientist.",
