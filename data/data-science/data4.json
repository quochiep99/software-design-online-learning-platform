It was a basic course and a good starter course. The graphing section was very interesting and I can see where I could use that in a small company that needs the details, but doesn't want to fork out cash for out of the box reporting capabilities.\n\nI have taken other online R courses in the past and the pace was a bit to fast or the ideas were abstract.",
