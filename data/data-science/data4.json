Additionally, for a course that is portrayed as 'R for Data Science', it is definitely lacking.\n\nThe section on 'ggplot' was done very well but perhaps could be improved further.\n\nOverall, I like Kirill's style and I do highly recommend this course for someone starting out in R.",

I am new to R and Python, and have been getting through some UDEMY Power BI training, and one of the last ones on using GGPLOT2 halted my progress. I tried installing R and getting the chart to load, but to no avail. I uninstalled, and installed different times, but I though in the towel, and searched UDEMY for R training, and found 3 courses by you, and after the very first chapter R and R Studio was installed. I am going to complete Python, Deep Learning, and another one of his courses before getting back to finishing the Power BI training. I like your method of training too much to stop right now. I am hoping to get R plots to work in Power BI at the end of this course. I love it.\n\nThank you.",
