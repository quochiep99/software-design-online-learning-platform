The good thing is this course builds some basic on Python programming before starting with DataFrame concepts which really helps. After this course I jumped on to python document site (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) to check my knowledge, was surprised to see most of topics were covered by this course, I was comfortable extending my knowledge to know more about functions/packages. Loved this course, hope you would too.",

The rest of the tutorial will give you the code/information needed to learn, but again, the narrator has maybe rehearsed this once and seems to narrate on the fly. If that narrator simply created a script to read off of, this would have been so much better. But it comes off like a high-school book report.",

Section 6 was particularly interesting with useful material for data analysis and eye-catching presentations. However, I expected that the homework challenges for each section should be more relevant to the tutorials of the section. The homework solutions video did not provide sufficient explanations on the method which was selected. The method per se was not always relevant to the tutorials of the section, rather based on the trainer's knowledge and expertise. As a result, it was not made clear for the attendees why they should choose the proposed methodology.\n\nOverall it was definitely a beneficial course and the trainer, Kiril, provided detailed and complete explanation of every line of code.",
