I had no prior knowledge about Python when I started this course and I am confident that I can code better in Python now! I took both R and Python. I enjoyed both courses. It is better to take both courses together so that we can compare and contrast both languages.\n\nThank you, Kirill. Great work.",

I only not liked the lengthiness in Section 6: Advanced Visualization. I wish to cut down it to 1-1.30hrs. Though visualization looks good to the eyes, too much makes boring. Section 7 can also cut by 30min. I would like love to devote those 2hrs to scikit-learn or something else. Overall good course for beginers.",
