I am very excited to be on this adventure in the space of AI, things are very interesting. I look forward to learn many other interesting AIs. Great course, thank you . Keep it up.",

            "body": "This is a good course. The theory part is especially very good and the tutor exactly knows what he is doing. The first AI, to build the self-driving car, was quite a difficult one to start with, considering no experience in the field. But eventually, you'll get along. The second one, Doom, was absolutely awesome and that is the one I enjoyed the most. That feeling when I saw my AI beat Doom is unexplainable :D. The third one, Breakout, is way too difficult, even the tutor mentioned that it is a bonus.\n\nOne feedback I'd like to give is that u could include a small intro to Pytorch and the functions of the same used to make the AIs in the course. Since this course has no requirements (but actually requires knowing PyTorch basics), the above could have been included.\n\nAnd explaining the structure of the AI beforehand dramatically before moving on to coding can make the coding part more intuitive, especially when starting off and not having any idea of what's ahead.\n\nAnd this course has a good support team. Never had to wait for more than a day for a reply. There are many topics that more than 20 people are equally doubtful about, so rather than asking the same question again and replying for the same, I'd recommend including the same in the course.\n\nNevertheless, the course was good overall. I took this course as a starter, and now I know the key areas I have to focus on to get a strong foundation in the field. And can boast about making an AI beat Doom. :D",

            "body": "I would say this course is fine but not that amazing. It will give you the right intuition and kickstart about understanding and working of AI but it won't make you confident enough on using or building your own AI. It has really good in detail theory part but implementation could have made simpler and easy. At some points so many concepts come up and you just lose interest and try to pace up with the code without understanding what's actually happening. I will consider it as more of a guide than a course to learn AI. But instructor has actually put a lot of efforts that can be seen. Secondly in Doom game project, if you're running windows 10 then probably either you have to go for a dual boot or use a virtual machine to run your training model which is something I actually don't like... There should have been something which should be compatible with all kinds or not if all atleast (Windows+Mac+Linux) OS. Thank you very much for this course!",

            "body": "The theory part was absolutely wonderful, I grasped every concept properly. I didn't like the coding part very much since it felt kind of rushed and also too complicated. Also, the course needs updating since many packages used in the course are outdated, especially for Doom module since it is no more available in the package. Maybe replace it with other game. But overall, I liked the course but I would really like to see it being updated.",
