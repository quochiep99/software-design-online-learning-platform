Otherwise it was a great course which teaches a lot of new things about AI.",

Also the explanation in some parts are not very clear. Somone need to research on many supporting materials. Like n-step Deep Q learning is not very clear. How the algorithm is implemeneted in the code. I guess more visualization should have been a better approach instead of only code walkthrough",

The first AI, to build the self-driving car, was quite a difficult one to start with, considering no experience in the field. But eventually, you'll get along. The second one, Doom, was absolutely awesome and that is the one I enjoyed the most. That feeling when I saw my AI beat Doom is unexplainable :D. The third one, Breakout, is way too difficult, even the tutor mentioned that it is a bonus.\n\nOne feedback I'd like to give is that u could include a small intro to Pytorch and the functions of the same used to make the AIs in the course. Since this course has no requirements (but actually requires knowing PyTorch basics), the above could have been included.\n\nAnd explaining the structure of the AI beforehand dramatically before moving on to coding can make the coding part more intuitive, especially when starting off and not having any idea of what's ahead.\n\nAnd this course has a good support team. Never had to wait for more than a day for a reply. There are many topics that more than 20 people are equally doubtful about, so rather than asking the same question again and replying for the same, I'd recommend including the same in the course.\n\nNevertheless, the course was good overall. I took this course as a starter, and now I know the key areas I have to focus on to get a strong foundation in the field. And can boast about making an AI beat Doom. :D",

            "body": "I would say this course is fine but not that amazing. It will give you the right intuition and kickstart about understanding and working of AI but it won't make you confident enough on using or building your own AI. It has really good in detail theory part but implementation could have made simpler and easy. At some points so many concepts come up and you just lose interest and try to pace up with the code without understanding what's actually happening. I will consider it as more of a guide than a course to learn AI. But instructor has actually put a lot of efforts that can be seen. Secondly in Doom game project, if you're running windows 10 then probably either you have to go for a dual boot or use a virtual machine to run your training model which is something I actually don't like... There should have been something which should be compatible with all kinds or not if all atleast (Windows+Mac+Linux) OS. Thank you very much for this course!",

As a newcomer to this field, for me was especially valuable the first part with all the theory behind what is happening in the ANNs. Although I do not have programing skills (yet), I also enjoyed the second part to see how it actually works. Granted, that seemed rather complicated for a non-programmer but that's fine as the value for me was to see how the theory becomes reality. My plan is to come back to this course after learning Python/Pytorch and go through that second section one more time to get all the value it provides. Congrats on how you put together this course and how you delivered the content!",
