            "body": "This course provides a fairly extensive overview of machine learning techniques. The information about neural networks is also very good, but not as extensive as the ML material - but that is due to the nature of neural netwoks/deep learning. Overall, this is a great course for people with wanting to learn about machine/deep learning and who have little to no prior exposure. By the end of the course, one should have a decent grasp of various methods employed in machine learning, and should also know where/what to look for further learning. Frank gives a good lecture and provides excellent insight as one might expect from a person with his experience in the field. One point of note: if you are not familiar with Python, you may struggle a bit when following along with the examples. If you are familiar with Python, then the examples are very clear and easy to understand.",

I can confidently say I successfully achieved my goals, however there is a way ahead to learn more.\n\nI highly recommend this course to everyone who is interested and curious to explore what Machine Learning is.\n\nAgain!
