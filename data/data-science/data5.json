Nonetheless, the Boltzmann Machines and AutoEncoder intuition and practical lectures were a bit too complicated and they definitely need revision on my behalf.

The one thing that I would like to say is that, probably, it would be better if you move the message from Section 22 (Annex) to the beginning, as an introduction. Many people (and me too) don't look at the final part of the course at the very beginning of the videos. For me, it would have been useful to know that I could go to the annex and revise some aspects of machine learning before starting the deep learning part.",
