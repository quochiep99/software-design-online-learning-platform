There are no Mac versions of these tools, so the student is left to provision a VM in Azure or AWS to host these tools. I'm sure some people will have no problems provisioning a VM. I tried, but I'm not deep technically, so this was a show-stopper for me. This should have been mentioned this up-front prior to me paying for the course and spending a lot of time on the first half of the course's lectures, assignments, etc.",

I must say it is a very good introduction to Data Science, it gives you the high-level logic required in approaching most practical aspects in real-world data science projects and taking up the machine learning and deep learning courses by Kirill will certainly turn anyone into a complete Data Scientist. These combined courses offered by Kirill, I bet will be among the top 1% complete data science courses here on Udemy",

SSIS and SQL where just abbreviations for me so far, now I have basic knowledge of it and am going to go deeper into it now. Comunication part was also enjoyable, perfect finish of this challenging course . Q&A is also very effective and well working in the course. The answers are prompt, detailed and individual, not just copy-paste. Thank you, Daniel!\n\nI will definately try other Kirill's courses, highly recommend to everybody starting their journey in DS.",

He is doing a great job by explaining in depth and in plain language, while giving you a lot of tips and examples. It might seem to some a bit slow, but I think it is worth while in the long term to have good foundations and clear understanding of the various subjects. I had previous knowledge in the data field but I can say the even someone without it, would succeed in understanding the material thanks to Kirill. For me personally it contributed a lot and I know now a lot more things. Thanks Kirill !!!",

But as I moved along, I started loving it, every part of it. Kirill was so good at his teaching and responses to my questions were so quick and helpful. I am glad to have been taken along on this Data Science journey. It was even more special since he added his personal experiences at the end.",
