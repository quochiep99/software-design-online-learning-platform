He is doing a great job by explaining in depth and in plain language, while giving you a lot of tips and examples. It might seem to some a bit slow, but I think it is worth while in the long term to have good foundations and clear understanding of the various subjects. I had previous knowledge in the data field but I can say the even someone without it, would succeed in understanding the material thanks to Kirill. For me personally it contributed a lot and I know now a lot more things. Thanks Kirill !!!",

SSIS and SQL where just abbreviations for me so far, now I have basic knowledge of it and am going to go deeper into it now. Comunication part was also enjoyable, perfect finish of this challenging course . Q&A is also very effective and well working in the course. The answers are prompt, detailed and individual, not just copy-paste. Thank you, Daniel!\n\nI will definately try other Kirill's courses, highly recommend to everybody starting their journey in DS.",

The way he taught, his slide and his explanation are very easy to understand. All of these make me want to jump into the data scientist world and take other Kirill's courses right now. Again, very very amazing course, I highly recommend this. Very statisfied.",

            "body": "Great introductory course on practical Data Science concepts and procedures. Avoids the pitfall of getting sucked too deeply into statistical math.\n\nKiril's presentation is first rate. I especially liked his use of many small video lessons, which makes the course easy to consume and also makes it easy to use the course material as a reference later. He comes across as very approachable, dealing with typos and short-term memory lapses just like the rest of us.\n\nThe only flaw, if you can call it that, is that occasionally he re-explains a point too many times or gives more hypothetical examples than necessary, which can drag out the lesson. But overall I'd rather have an instructor err on that side than that opposite.\n\nThis course has given me the confidence to dig deeper into Data Science. I'm heading on to more courses, but most importantly I feel ready to start practicing on real projects.",

I would suggest you to take specific courses like A-Z Tableau, or A-Z SQL.\n\nAlso there are just few homework practice examples at the end of the sections which I need the most!",

The instruction have great practical knowledge on the material.\n\nMaybe I had higher expectation of the course since it is named \"A-Z\", although I felt that \"Applied data science\" or \"Practical data science foundations\" would be a better suited title.\n\nIn summary, good introductory course into data science.\n\nP.S I am taking A-Z Machine learning next from Krill, so hopefully it will cover the gaps!",

Although it may not be very technical and doesn't dive very deep into things like ML or any of the programming language data scientists can work in, I understand it wasn't designed that way (in fact Kirill talks about that in one of the starting tutorials). There are separate courses which cover those topics and I'm sure going to try them out. I really enjoyed the data prep section, where the whole ETL process may seem tedious at first, but Kirill provides almost 100% bulletproof methods and blueprints to go through it as quickly and efficiently as you can. Also, big thanks for presentation section, didn't see any other course cover this topic yet.",
