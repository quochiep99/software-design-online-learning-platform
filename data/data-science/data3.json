            "body": "So honestly this course acts like a foundation to get into data science field, it introduces you to the data science field and what to expect from it. I personally enjoyed the learning experience. Here are some pros and cons for fellow students like me out there:-\n\nPros\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) Math and logic lectures are simply awesome.. almost 50% of the course has math lectures which shows how focused this course is on building foundation.\n\n2) Quizzes and exercises that help you start brainstorming ideas.\n\n3) Videos are short and to the point which I consider as advantage because it encourages you to dig deep and do some research on your own.\n\nCons\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) Introduction to python is not that great, I would suggest to get some programming experience. before you start the section(especially OOP).\n\nAll and all it was a good learning experience. Great job 365 team!",

The videos are interactive and dynamic. The Q&A section it's up-to-date, and the instructors answer really fast!\n\nI recommend it for begginers.",

            "body": "So I just finished this course today. The lecture contents was long and exhaustive. I can tell the instructors had put in a lot of efforts and time to make the lectures interesting. The total hours for this course is 29 hours, and i think it took me like 60 hours due to stopping, replaying, stopping again, and taking notes etc. Overall, I think they could have done better. Some suggestions I think this course could improve on:\n\n1. python - when you introduce the codes there should have been some markups with arrows and bullet points stating what that code does and when you run the code show us with markings what it does. Most of the time the instructor will get overly excited when he runs the code and not explaining what's going on. Also when you add a code, to add some columns show us where it will end up and mark them on the videos. More bullet point notes the better. Sometimes you introduce new codes and don't exactly explain what it does and it gets so confusing. And you also copy and paste codes from somewhere and expect us to understand what you did as it went over my head. Because this Python part is so important to all of us learning for the first time, and eventually we'll get into Data Science in our careers one day, this section needs to be improved on so we all can better understand what's going on.\n\n2. TF1 vs TF2 - I don't think there's any need to go comparing both of these as TF2 is current and mostly what we are trying to learn now right? Also getting TF2 to install was a nightmare as some people had the same issue.\n\n3. Intro. to the field of Data Science - These lectures are way too long. You have 8 sections describing this and could have sum up in a few lectures stating what it does and the types of careers one can go into with the type of skill sets. Sorry but I was about to fall asleep.\n\n4. Mathematics - Maybe need to add basic Calculus\n\n5. Probability and Stats - it was long but alright.\n\n6. Other items to add - SQL and Big Data, just the basic stuffs and how to integrate these into Python, and discuss what software we'll need to learn etc.\n\n7. Lecture Videos - Quality could be better as the video seems a bit blurry or low quality.\n\n8. Instructors - As most students stated that the instructors voice sounded like a robot and not a real human teaching and I totally agree. I won't drill into too much but I find the instructor who was teaching the Case Study for the Absenteeism (Preprocessing) does a good job as he uses markups to indicate how the code was executed and carried out.\n\nI did enjoyed it and learned some skills along the way. Thanks.",

            "body": "It has helped me refresh my memory on several concepts I haven't touched upon since my university study years. At certain points, the explanation does seem to be lacking depth, but I guess that's a trade-off they had taken into account from the start. I just feel that the first few sections of the course took up from the course's duration some valuable time that could've been better spent.\n\nI would love to see clearer explanations and more discussions regarding the outputs of the regression for example. It just seems that towards the end, the pace gets faster because the content gets flatter.\n\nNevertheless, this is a very powerful Bootcamp that has definitely helped me gain confidence in tackling some data science cases and I will probably keep referencing its Jupyter notebooks as a stepping stone in practical challenges.",
