At the end all the Assumptions are not covered and that leaves lack clarity on the subject. At the start of regression, the session started of saying it is based on ANOVA. It is not that every person has idea on ANOVA. The coach could have given some clarity on what ANOVA is about. Apart from that till Hypothesis testing the course was great but after that it was a bit fast and lillte hard to understand for a person who is not from Statistic background. Thanks a lot sir for the great explanation of all the topics and I personally wish there could be more examples for regression analysis at the end of the session covering all the assumption and interpretation of the data.
