        "briefIntroduction": "<p> Hi! I'm Rob. I have a degree in Mathematics from Cambridge University and you might call me a bit of coding geek. </p>\n<p> After building websites for friends and family for fun, I soon learned that web development was a very lucrative career choice. I gave up my successful (and sometimes stressful) job as a teacher to work part time and today, couldn't be happier. </p>\n<p> I'm passionate about teaching kids to code, so every summer I run Code School in the beautiful city of Cambridge. I also run the popular web hosting and design service, Eco Web Hosting which leaves me free to share my secrets with people like you. </p>\n<p> <strong>You wouldn't believe the freedom that being a web developer offers.</strong> Sign up and find out for yourself why so many people are taking and recommending this course. I genuinely believe it's the best on the market and if you don't agree, I'll happily refund your money. </p>\n<p> Sign up to my courses and join me in this amazing adventure today. </p>"
