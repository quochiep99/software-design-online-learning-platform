When it comes to explaining something you do it in detail and understandable, but the problem with the course like others I've taken from you always happens the same, too much go forward and backward, why you don't take a topic and finish it completely, example when you first create the authentication page why you doesn't explain everything about this and DO NOT go to another page or topic (unless you need to, like if it is going to be injected another service or so) but there I GOT LOST, so difficult because of the large list of pages that were created at the beginning, is very difficult to locate some of them.\n\nSo if you're going to explain about offers, dedicate the module to just that, and not be in offer, then go to discover, then back to offer then go to login, I think you got my point.\n\nThanks",

        "briefIntroduction": "<p><strong>Experience as (Web) Developer</strong><br></p><p>Starting out at the age of 13 I never stopped learning new programming skills and languages. Early I started creating websites for friends and just for fun as well. Besides web development I also explored Python and other non-web-only&nbsp;languages.&nbsp;This passion has since lasted and lead to my decision of working as a freelance web developer and consultant. The success and fun I have in this job is immense and really keeps that passion burningly alive.</p><p>Starting web development on&nbsp;the backend (PHP with Laravel, NodeJS, Python) I also became more and more of a frontend developer using modern frameworks like React, Angular or VueJS 2 in a lot of projects. I&nbsp;love both worlds nowadays!</p><p>As a self-taught developer I had the chance to broaden my horizon by studying Business Administration where I hold a Master's degree. That enabled me to work in a major strategy consultancy as well as a bank. While learning, that I enjoy development more than these fields, the time in this sector greatly improved my overall experience and skills.</p><p><strong>Experience as Instructor</strong></p><p>As a self-taught professional I really know the hard parts and the difficult topics when learning new or improving on already-known languages. This background and experience enables me to focus on the most relevant key concepts and topics. My track record of many 5-star rated courses, more than 700,000 students on Udemy as well as a successful YouTube channel is the best proof for that.</p><p>Whether working as development instructor or teaching Business Administration I always received great feedback. The most rewarding experience is to see how people find new, better jobs, build awesome web applications, acquire amazing projects or simply enjoy their hobby with the help of my content.</p><p>Together with Manuel Lorenz, I founded Academind to offer the best possible learning experience to our more than 800,000 students.</p>",
