Also many questions of students are still unanswered. Overall it was a great experience to learn many (or most ) of the features that work in Android. Thanks!",

Just see the app names in course description. Could have well made a course in Arabic like his youtube channel if he's not comfortable in English.\n\n- Hasn't put much effort in editing the videos. Bad audio. Some videos have so low audio that I had to depend on the half correct subtitles.\n\n- Can't make good UI or even write good code. Can't even explain why he's doing things the way he is. To be honest, I'm not sure how he got to work in Google & Microsoft or maybe those are plain lies like is claim of having MILLIONS of users on his apps.\n\n- Just goes around problems instead of fixing them or even explaining them. Not sure if this bad teaching or just lack of knowledge. I think it is the later.\n\n- He has earned millions by making poor courses like these thanks to his guardian's money which got him into USA & also thanks to his mentors(mostly from his background who helped him blindly) in Rochester Institute of Technology who gave him more than a helping hand. I indeed did research about him everywhere & came to these conclusions.\n\nIf you're reading this, you're lucky I faced this fraud & not you. Don't waste your money on this course.",

J'avais déja des bonnes notions de Kotlin avant de commencer le cours et je vois plein de fois ou le code pourrait être bien plus pratique en Kotlin plutot qu'en Java\n\n(renseignez vous sur les constructeurs en Kotlin et les listes. Rien que ça, ça sera tellement mieux que ce qui est montré dans le cours)\n\nLe plus gros défaut du cours a mes yeux c'est que le cours n'est pas préparé. Le \"professeur\" code sans savoir ce qu'il va faire, il se retrouve donc confronté a beaucoup de bug qu'il résoud juste en prenant la première solution proposée par Android Studio.\n\nCela provoque l'effet désagréable de regarder le cours sans savoir si ce qu'il dit est vrai et fonctionnel. Un nombre de fois incalculable le code écrit est remplacé pour une raison X ou Y.\n\nEt quand il ne trouve pas la solution, il met en pause la vidéo pour aller nous sortir une solution sorti de nul part.\n\nPour les exercices, les seuls exercices que vous aurez sont 3 questions basiques en début de cours du genre 1+1 = ? mais quand on rentre dans le vif du sujet, le contenu du cours nous laisse juste spectateur.\n\nPour résumer, ce cours n'est pas un tutoriel mais une présentation d'applications faite par un développeur lambda.\n\nJe pense que le tuto peut servir pour des gens qui veulent approfondir leurs connaissances mais n'apprenez surtout pas Kotlin avec ce tuto, votre code fonctionnera mais vous vous ferez virer de vos boulots avec un code pareil.",

The author creates methods and attributes as needed, without following any order structure.\n\n- Kotlin? Half. Use kotlin to program and it works. But it constantly uses expressions that it shouldn't use. For example, he uses the second constructor instead of the main one, he is constantly using !! to avoid checking nulls, he doesn't use data classes either ... it's one after another\n\n- Some apps don't even finish them, because they get so confusing that even he doesn't seem to know how to go on. Like the TicTacToe example.\n\n- Many applications do not work, for example the alarm. Or anyone that involves using external services (weather application, Maps application ...)\n\n- He does not answer questions or have someone to answer them. Basically you have access to these videos and code, but nothing else.\n\nI am disappointed with the course.",
