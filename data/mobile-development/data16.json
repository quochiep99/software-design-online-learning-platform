The content Mark has put together is not only useful for a future career in iOS development but the way in which Mark is able to explain complicated situations to someone who has no idea about this field is the best part. Making complex scenarios so easy to understand is a skill Mark has mastered. I haven't completed the course yet and have already signed up for more.\n\nHighly recommended",

Mark is a very experienced developer, and a great teacher as well. This course will not only teach you all of the technical know how that you need to know, but it will also teach you how to design apps to make them more attractive to users. From all that I have learned so far, it is safe to say that this course will give you a great start in an iOS Development career either working for yourself, an already established company, or whatever you choose to do with the knowledge learned in this course.",

            "body": "I actually found Mark's course after frustration with, frankly the sheer ugliness of the UI elements used in another iOS course. Also there was a complete lack of modularity/design patterns/best practices in the other course.\n\nBy contrast, Mark pays special attention to the user interface/design/typography but NOT at a sacrifice to teaching you to create compelling apps with efficient, robust code underneath. In app after app, all building on each other in a very clear gradient of expanding scope/difficulty, both UI and code are explained in detail and with clarity. Mark's enthusiasm is infectious, there were times, even though I love Swift/iOS dev, I was just feeling a bit overwhelmed, and within 5 minutes of feeling the enthusiasm and excitement from Mark, I was back in the zone. Mark also covers, (and heretofore, mysterious to me), essentials, such as UIStackview, terminal, Git, GitHub, Cocoapods, third party frameworks such as Alamofire and Firebase all with just the right amount of depth to extract the essence of what you need to know but always a keen focus on the practical.\n\nHe has an *invaluable* section on career prep, and it's a refreshingly NO-BS, candid, and motivational discussion on the topic. He also walks you through what appears to be the rather byzantine (painful?) process of submitting your app to the app store, and doesn't just glaze over stuff. He realizes that even things that can appear simple when they're explained can be much more complicated when you're actually alone and doing by yourself.\n\nEach app project Mark walks you through from start to finish, with no editing. You see him choose assets, install 3rd party tools, fuss around with autolayout, debug when necessary. Therefore you see the *process* itself which can involve trial and error and that there is no illusion that the creative/dev process is some tidy straight line.\n\nDid I mention there is a section on Photoshop (again dev essentials focused) as well? Mark also continues to add new content to the course based directly on feedback he receives from his students.\n\nMy only critique, would be that a side lesson on Swift closures/(blocks) would be of great benefit if one were added. This is such a key area to understand in the later apps, and a sidebar lesson, especially explained in Mark's unique style would be fantastic towards shoring up a concept that is often confusing. It would also be cool to have a section on freelancing in the career dev area. However in the sum total of the course, those are minor concerns and are more than overshadowed by the quality of the course as a whole.\n\nMark teaches from the perspective of what's practical with a clear goal on making you self-sufficient, and not relying on a designer, or leaving you scratching your head as to WHY he chose a certain layout, or a certain approach to the code. At the same time, you'll be having a LOT of fun along the way. I really can't say enough positive things about this course. My thanks to Mark Price for creating it.",

I was confused with the required, convenience initializers in first place but I figured out with some help on devslopes. All in all this course is great, really great. Valuable and solid information is provided by mark and I think if you really want to master ios this course can help you reallly good with it. I say gogoogogog mark and I am looking forward for the advanced ios course. Thank you so much <3\n\nUpdated:\n\nThis course was amazing and I already did some other courses of mark too. iOS 10 is the course I am taking right now and currently I am developing my new app called: ActiveRest. It uses algorithm and gives the user smarts tips in powerlifting. Mark stay tuned to review this amazing app! :D",
