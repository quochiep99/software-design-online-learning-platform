Also, for database they focused on parser which is not used now instead of firebase\n\nWas this review helpful?\n\nReport\n\nRob Percival\n\nInstructor response\nâ€¢\n3 months ago\n\nHi Somya, thanks for your comment and I hope you enjoyed the course. The project replicates the app and puts to use all the skills students have learned in the preceding lectures, but I'm sorry if you felt it wasn't comprehensive enough. The course is a little older now, which if why I use parser in database, but I'll take your feedback on board. Thanks, and happy coding.",

However all lectures were somehow usefull and of course there is a lot you can do on your own after this to improve learning. If you do all the excercises properly it might take a few months to complete, but it would be totally worth it. Thanks to COVID-19 I was able to find the time (and price discount) to finish it.",

I have a degree in Mathematics from Cambridge University and you might call me a bit of coding geek.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t       After building websites for friends and family for fun, I soon learned that web development was a very lucrative career choice. I gave up my successful (and sometimes stressful) job as a teacher to work part time and today, couldn't be happier.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t       I'm passionate about teaching kids to code, so every summer I run Code School in the beautiful city of Cambridge. I also run the popular web hosting and design service, Eco Web Hosting which leaves me free to share my secrets with people like you.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>You wouldn't believe the freedom that being a web developer offers.</strong> Sign up and find out for yourself why so many people are taking and recommending this course.  I genuinely believe it's the best on the market and if you don't agree, I'll happily refund your money.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t       Sign up to my courses and join me in this amazing adventure today.  </p>"
