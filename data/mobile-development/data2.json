Later on when the course deviates to older version of react-native, which deals with class components and redux, Steven does explain the basics of react-native. So if you are a newbie you should start from there.\n\nLastly I want to say that the Context and useReducer were complicated topics for me. But after doing it 3 - 4 times inside the course, it became clearer. This course was really useful for me and I would highly recommend it. And I would do the advanced version of this course also. ?",

Stephen is super easy to follow, he´s got superb teaching skills that are really helpful, no matter how advanced or amateur you are. I just purchased another of his courses, React Native: Advanced Concepts, in order to improve advanced concepts such as animations, local data persistence, etc. To fully complete my training, I´ll enroll on a third course to learn how to manage the backend (also from Stephen).
