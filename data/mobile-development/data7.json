I get what he is trying to say, but I think for beginners it is more important to understand the up-to-date concepts and touch more on real examples like form validation using 3rd party libraries, and so forth. It makes it very confusing following the old stuff and updating it to the new. Now I have to run the concept of react-navigation v5. I like him all the time but hope to update this lecture in the short future.",

Also, I think the course relays a lot on Expo tooling, at some point, it feels like an expo's course where you can run react code in a mobile device instead of a cross platform app, although it has a module dedicated to working outside expo's environment I feel it was kind of shallow.",
