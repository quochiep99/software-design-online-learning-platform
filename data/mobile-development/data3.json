Her lessons and course exercises are structured in such a way that it is easy to understand, without being too slow or too fast-paced to follow along with. She breaks down really complex concepts into simple, understandable chunks. As icing on the cake, her sense of humor is delightful!\n\nThis course not only demystifies Swift and XCode, but also teaches really important concepts like the Model/View/Controller pattern and Github. Good lord, THANK YOU Angela for including Git in this tutorial. It's ridiculous how many coding courses Ive taken with no mention of it at all.\n\nMy only problems with this course are that sometimes the audio cuts and repeats, or sometimes she dives into using a concept that she has not yet explained and then goes back to explain it in a later lesson. ALSO- I would recommend grabbing the latest version of the course for iOS 13 if you can, because some things are out of date in this course.\n\nOther than that, I have no complaints. Angela is truly awesome and if you have the discipline to get through the course, you will learn a ton even in the first 20 hours. My only other wish is that there would be some bonus lectures on NFC encoding but I can understand why its omitted since you need an iPhone X or later plus NFC cards/wristbands to read and write NFC with an app.",
