            "body": "Many thanks for a very interesting course. One really learns a lot. Unfortunately, a few things are no longer up to date - but this has the advantage that you get more involved with the topic. From my point of view 2 aspects are not well solved. The TaskTimer app is very complex. It would have been better to teach some concepts in smaller projects. Furthermore, the TaskTimer App was not programmed completely. The chapter for settings is missing. Nevertheless, anyone who wants to learn programming should take a look at this course. Some programming experience would be helpful.",

I learned a lot specially the fundamentals of building an android app.\n\nThere were some lectures that are a little bit outdated but if you research them online, you can find a workaround on it. The instructors are also responsive if you have any questions so there's no reason not to ask them. Thank you Tim and Jean for this very good course!",

But with \"but\"s.\n\n+ The content of this course is VERY big, valuable, lots of useful techniques, unobvious approaches, Android lifehacks and design tricks.\n\n+ Jean-Paul usually replies questions very fast and this is a great support!\n\n+ Tim speaks on video with optimal speed: many lecturers speek too slow and make course too long, not in this case. This means, more information is packed in these 60 hours of lectures.\n\n- MANY times I was like, \"what`s going on?\" because the explanation style is: \"coding on screen, telling what the code does\". This is master class, yes, not a definitive course of lectures, but more visual material (e.g. illustrating how different parts of Android ecosystem work) would be of great help. Tables with app structure helped a lot, but there are just a few of them.\n\n- Course has a cliffhanger \"we will make app settings in the next video\" and there`s no next video, it is the end of the course. (as of 31.07.2020). I hope it will be finished.\n\nConclusion: I would recommend this course to any person who is gonna be Android developer, though not as a first, \"introduction\" course.",

I think this course doesn't include things about gaming coding but (I think) if you want to get a job as Android Developer, it is very useful course to reach your goal.Just have a problem that we need to code \"Setting\" menu in last lecture but he finished this course and There is no make sense to creating \"Duration\" column in Durations Report menu.
