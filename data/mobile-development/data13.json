The next thing is that even tho Mosh talked a lot about \"clean coding\", I find the code far away from being clean, but I guess having it as clean as it could be was not the original aim of this course.",

It has to be noted that Xamarin has advanced since the making of this course, so some workarounds are not necessary and who knows, there are other things added to Xamarin in the mean time that should be added in this course too.\n\nOn some topics I would have liked some more in depth material, but since the course covers the basics, it is easier to google for solutions.",

Points to improve this course are, better Android examples, more exercises, examples about peripherals, Storage Data and customize screens.",
