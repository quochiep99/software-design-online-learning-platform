Also the approach Ardit took with showing that errors and crashes is something typical for the programming process and the students should learn how to work through the errors is really great.\n\nThe final project was not complex, the only thing I stuck upon was about how to put the table\n\ninto HTML page. It was not obvious for me, that I can simply create an empty placeholder in the HTML\n\npage and then fill-it in upon rendering the page. I tried to create a new HTML-page and embed it or use\n\nthe jinja template but it had not worked. Also Ardit added the check-ups if the uploaded file is indeed of csv type and content, while I simply checked if file contains the address column.\n\nI really loved the course.\n\nThe only thing I can suggest for the course improvement is to add even more exercises or another project for self-practice.\n\nMany thanks Ardit!",

I have used Python as a data science tool and a language to develop both desktop and web applications. I have been using Python with the Center for Conservation Geography to map and understand Australian ecosystems, process drone land images with the Swiss in-Terra, and perform data mining to gain business insights with the Australian Rapid Intelligence.</p><p>I will teach you how you can use Python, just like I do. I take care to explain the programming concepts assuming my students do not have a computer science background. Indeed, you do not need a computer science degree to become a programmer.</p><p>I graduated with a Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies from the University of Muenster in Germany. I am also the Founder and Author of PythonHow, a Python learning resource designed particularly for people with no previous programming experience. Try out one of my courses, and you will be in for an exciting ride.</p>",
