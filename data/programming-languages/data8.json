(I enjoyed the 6th application the most utmost) I urge you to attempt this course if you are studying Python as a beginner or intermediate. Ardit Sulce is a transcendent instructor and appreciations and thankfulness for developing this course! Also acknowledgements to the community and teaching assistant(David) for the amazing support and assistance! What an ascent!",

However, lots of outdated content, some programs don't work, instructor switches to different application in the middle of the course, some questions remain unanswered while various explanations are not very clear.\n\nWhen instructor makes mistakes, he doesn't even bother to reupload the clean video, instead add notes, in some instances there were over 2 notes and additional comments added. Such a mess.\n\nThis course is a good introduction to Python but be aware of unclear explanations, program not installing and ultimately there will be errors in your code and YOU WILL HAVE TO SOLVE THEM on your own.!",

There is some part more interesting to me than the others.\n\nHowever, it's very nice to learn and see what Python can do. All modules in this course help building your python skill as a programmer.\n\nThe apps that we made are proper in term of complexity, difficulty, and time limit. This course really get your hands dirty. It's a real learning by practicing course and not simply syntax learning.\n\nI also like instructor's manner. He is quite funny and easy to listen to. You will see many errors happening here and there in this course. Personally, I think it's not a bad thing because you see how to fix it (or google) and be familiar with the exceptions which is part of programming job..fixing bugs or try out solutions.\n\nLast but not the least is Q&A support, I would say it's second to none. Course Assistant is super supportive and respond in short time. He does pay attention to help and give advices to students.\n\nThank you Ardit for such a big amazing course and David for your kind support to students.\n\nI look forward for The Python Mega Course: Season2!",

I have used Python as a data science tool and a language to develop both desktop and web applications. Some of the projects I have worked on have been using Python together with the Center for Conservation Geography to map and understand the Australian ecosystems, process drone land images with the Swiss in-Terra, and performing data mining to gain business insights with the Australian Rapid Intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>I will teach you how you can use Python, just like I do. I take care to explain the programming concepts assuming my students don't have a computer science background. Indeed, you don't need a computer science degree to become a programmer. </p><p>I was graduated with a Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies from the University of Muenster in Germany. I am also the founder and author of PythonHow, a Python learning resource designed particularly for people with no previous programming experience. Try out one of my courses, and you will be on for an exciting ride.</p>"
