            "body": "ating: 1.0 out of 5\n2 months ago\n\nI want to start by saying I have always been good at analytical thought processing. I was always good at math, so while I'm new to programming it's not something I find to be inherently difficult or abstract. Also, I have gotten through most of this course already so it's not like I started a few videos, didn't like them, and quit. I've been pushing through and intend to finish the course but at this point I can see that certain things are not going to change towards the end.\n\nThe structure of this course is just horrible. Apparently they are working on a revision which I believe should help to some degree as it became blatantly obvious when I got past the revised portion and into the original course material.\n\nThe first problem I have with the structure is that there is very little thought put into prioritization. It seems like there is just as much time and emphasis put on things that are trivial as there is on the core concepts that you are trying to learn. For instance, he literally spends about 1.5 hours on time zones. If I want to become an expert on time zones I can look that up on my own time. I'm trying to learn programming here, sure time zones are a valuable thing to know how to implement, but they are hardly essential to the main goal of learning how to program.\n\nSecond, there is not very much drilling of core concepts. There are really no big projects that help you to put what you learn into practice. Other courses I've taken in Javascript, HTML/CSS, have had projects along the way so you get comfortable with what you've learned so far before moving on.\n\nThird, this seems like almost as much of a trouble shooting class as a teaching class. I understand that trouble shooting is VERY important in programming. However, the lessons are so often interrupted with trouble shooting tips that you kind of lose focus on the main reason most people take the class, learning to do things correctly. This is probably a feature that may be beneficial to people who are intermediate Python programmers, but for those of us who are beginners as the course advertises it is meant for, the trouble shooting really can be distracting from just learning the correct ways of doing things. Might be beneficial to have a separate trouble shooting section at the end of the course instead of constantly interrupting the study flow of students showing them how to deal with this and that along the way that really shouldn't be happening if they are writing their code correctly. Usually this occurs in the middle of a video, but sometimes is just inserted into a section as a random separate video that is not necessarily just applicable to that sections material. For instance, halfway through the SQL/Database section we just stop and get into 1.5 hours worth of videos about exception handling. I get that exception handling is applicable to SQL/databases, but it is far from being exclusively applicable to that area of Python, so why stop in the middle of SQL/databases, why not just add it in it's own section or at least at the beginning or end of the database section instead of stopping right in the middle?\n\nFourth, trial and error. I get that programming entails a lot of trial and error, however, when you're new at something you'll make enough typos and other errors all on your own. These videos were made seemingly with little prior plan for how goals would be achieved. The instructor seems to be processing how he's going to do things as he does them. This leads to students sometimes being told to type code that doesn't execute correctly and then having to adjust it along with the instructor after they've already spent time typing a bunch of stuff out. Also a lot of things that may not necessarily cause code not to execute but that the instructor tells you to do it one way and then halfway through just realizes that the way he had done it is not the best way to do it and has you change it.\n\nFifth, similar names. Throughout the course the instructor will use a similar names for multiple things in a video or even the same name with the only difference being one start with a capitalized letter and one without or one is plural and one is not, etc etc. This makes in difficult to follow what is supposed to be going where as you're writing code. Am I referring to a class or a variable? etc, etc. It also makes it less obvious what previously written code is referring to as you're watching the video, is this code referring back to the Class, to a variable, to a function? May seem obvious to an intermediate student but to a beginner it makes the learning process more difficult. It also makes it unnecessarily difficult to catch errors when your code doesn't execute properly.\n\nFinally, too much going on in a single video. To be fair, this does seem to be something they are addressing in the up coming revised version. But very often in this course you will be working on a concept, you'll learn how to do it, and then rather than leaving that video finished and having that in your mind as to how that concept/process should be done, he'll continue the video and have you erase what you've done to show you another way of doing it, and then another way of doing it, and then another way of doing it. By the end you're kind of like \"what the hell was I supposed to be learning to begin with?\". Probably better to just start a new video, create a new file, copy the code from the other file, and then change it to learn another variation of how to do something. It would help with keeping different concepts/processes separate in your mind.\n\nOverall I think this course is difficult and frustrating for a beginner to follow. I would imagine that it would not be as difficult for an intermediate student to follow, but might still be just as frustrating.",
