            "body": "Really good course, Tim is very knowledgeable and walks through each lesson step by step. It can occasionally get tough once you start getting to the more intermediate/advanced lectures, but stick with it and go over previous lectures so you're in step with what Tim is trying to teach. My only snag is that when I went through the course, it was/is in the process of being remastered. At the crossover point, where it goes back to the older videos, it was a little confusing and the lectures were quite long. That being said, I recommend this course whatever level you're at with Python, it will teach you a lot. Thanks for the great course Tim - I'm feeling a lot more confident with Python, I have a deeper understanding and I've learnt a lot from this course.",

The only problem with it is that it is currently being redone, and just like a road that's under construction it can be a hassle and hard to recommend.

I wish my college courses worked this way, they drag the same amount of material out over months.\" - Thomas Neal<br><br>\"I love this guy. I'm in school for java right now at a local college and I bought this course hoping it would help clarify the fuzzy areas of my coursework. There's no comparison. Every time I get lost in my textbook, I watch a couple more of these videos and I'm right back on track. He explains everything so perfectly. It sinks right in.\" - Kristen Andreani<br><br>\"Tim is a great instructor, I have more courses from him and all are great.
