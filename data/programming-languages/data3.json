            "body": "This was a really intense great course! It was fully packed with knowledge with lots of ways to achieve things, so I feel really prepared to take on my own first project!\n\nAt stages I thought I got lost (especially Section 7), but when I repeatedly watched some videos/concepts it became clear. In section 7 I was close to giving up, but then I read a comment that it would all become much clearer towards the end of the course, so that I shouldn't worry too much if I don't get it immediately. This helped me a lot! Thanks for whoever commented this advice! It was actually true. So, I watched the videos, but didn't care to understand everything in detail and it was true, it all made much more sense later in the course.\n\nI especially liked the way Max taught some concepts first in a separate project and then using it on the Burger Builder project which definitely enhanced the comprehension of the concepts.\n\nMax has a really good feeling for where the potential difficulties are and recaps those points a lot which makes it stick even better.\n\nThanks a lot for this! Now it's time for me to practice.",
