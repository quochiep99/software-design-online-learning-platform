Also, the course touches some external libraries, after passing which, ideas of practical implementation of your Python skills may start occur in your mind.\n\nHowever, I found these following cons of the course:\n\n- It really touches ONLY language, i.e. not Computer Science itself. You most likely start to understand how the language works but without real fundamentals behind it.\n\n- Especially OOP part, it does won't teach you how you should THINK in order to code in OOP paradigm. For me, that was critical. And because of this I dropped this course multiple times. Only after A LOT of googling, I started to comprehend this paradigm.\n\n- Sometimes, I caught the feeling that I was just following what Jose doing. In some parts, this course won't teach you, but just gives you 'mechanical' exercises passing which you don't think too much.\n\n- Taking into the account aforementioned, you MUST google a lot and READ documentations a lot in order to grab deep understanding of programming (not Python itself).\n\nDespite so large 'cons' lists, I really recommend this course. It brings real value for its price. And with a good motivation it may push you to learn programming further.\n\nThanks, Jose, for the course. It was a real pleasure following it. You did a great job! :)",
