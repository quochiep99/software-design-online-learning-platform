I'm happy to have gotten through the course and I learned a lot about Python that was surely invaluable.\n\nIf there is one thing I can complain about; it's that the exercises were a bit too challenging and sometimes too much so that it didn't make me feel like I was learning, while others were surprisingly simple.\n\nBut other than that, great course. Highly recommended!",

I've spent the last few years teaching people to program at 2 different immersive bootcamps where <strong>I've helped hundreds of people become web developers and change their lives.</strong> My graduates work at companies like Google, Salesforce, and Square.</p><p>Most recently, I led Galvanize's SF's 6 month immersive program as <strong>Lead Instructor</strong> and <strong>Curriculum Director.</strong> After graduating from my class, 94% of my students went on to receive full-time developer roles. I also worked at Udacity as a <strong>Senior Course Developer </strong>on the web development team where I got to reach thousands of students daily. </p><p>I’ve since focused my time on bringing my classroom teaching experience to an online environment. In 2016 I launched my <strong>Web Developer Bootcamp course</strong>, which has since gone on to become one of the best selling and top rated courses on Udemy. I was also voted <strong>Udemy’s Best New Instructor of 2016.</strong> </p><p>I've spent years figuring out the \"formula\" to teaching technical skills in a classroom environment, and I'm really excited to finally share my expertise with you. I can confidently say that my online courses are without a doubt the most comprehensive ones on the market. </p><p><strong>Join me on this crazy adventure!</strong></p>",
