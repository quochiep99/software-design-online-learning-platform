Also, for some of the challenges, they required use to use code which would be explained later in the course, not at present time. I found myself saying “I didn’t know that I could have done that” often. I had no choice but to look at the solutions in order to find the answer.",

While this is valid coding, it can be very confusing.\n\nSecond, he should really go back and fix the quizzes. These should be 100% accurate and they aren't. I stopped doing them because I was getting marked wrong on answers that turned out to be correct which added more confusion.\n\nTo repeat, I have purchased and gone through a couple of the other beginning C# courses and this is by far the best and definitely well enough put together to learn the material.",

It omits much of the 'filler' you usually get with beginner courses, which is why the course length is kept low. If you need to get going with C#/.NET quickly, and you have very little spare time, this is the perfect course.\n\nI dropped half a star for Mosh's liberal use of 'var', even Microsoft themselves recommend against using it so casually. Debate on this is almost religious, and it appears experienced programmers have their preferences, but I think to teach the practice to beginners is a mistake.\n\nOtherwise, its a superb course, and I've bought the next two parts on that basis.",
