I definitely learned a lot, going over all basic and not so basic concepts in Python programming, including Data Science and Machine Learning (the most exciting part for me), among other interesting and useful subjects. All the famous and most popular libraries, IDEs, and Flask framework, are included in the course. The course also leads you to an amazing and supportive Discord community, where you can discuss your code, share your progress, find help and coding buddies. They have also Github community, where you can work with others or on your own on open source projects and maybe share these contributions on your resume. I'll be coming back to this course to complete the 100 Python exercises.\n\nThanks very much Andrei for this course! You're saying it's important for you to provide value to others and to the world. I think that you've definitely achieved that via your courses and community! It's a great benefit for the world to have you existing! :)\n\nAlso, special thanks to the teaching assistant William, who was all the time with me throughout my journey with this course and always helped me out, whenever I was stuck with difficult, or silly situations, and took the time to clarify for me concepts, which I had troubles with at first!\n\nI can't really describe all the amazing features of this course in such a review, but there are many more. Keep up the good work, guys!",

Previously, I have gone with other developers who taught python and I got lost and didn't enjoy it, and when I came across Andrei - everything got easier and things started to make sense.\n\nThis course, not only teaches the solid foundation but also moves onto the advanced concepts (which my previous courses never went into) but also goes into projects - which are amazing, and I think that's where this course goes beyond from the others.\n\nI have liked Andrei's teaching style a lot and I have brought his Machine Learning Course and his web development course which I start very soon. Thank you for such an amazing course Andrei.",

An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;\n\nHaving learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree.
