Totally worth investing for your NodeJS learning.\n\nThe important improvement I really suggest and request is to add the Front-End side of the Task App in order to complete the app given most of the learners I believe in beginner to intermediate level. For learners, this addition would make their learning much more fulfilled and it is a quite important skill being able to connect Back-End to the Front-End and making it a whole app.\n\nThis course is quite a journey. Thank you Andrew and Adam for making this course for us.",

I liked Andrew's way of teaching and he has really worked hard. I especially liked the JWT section, the deployment part, and the mini todo challenges. I am giving 4.5/5, not 5/5 because I think at the end of the course there should be a project where we can apply all we have learned that will be best and a small introduction to Javascript at the beginning of course.",

Most importantly, he provides challenges on most videos, really forcing you to learn the material. This, in addition to his clear and concise teaching is what really sets his course apart from all the other really good teachers on Udemy. Furthermore he covers all the essentials in his course material. I really can't find much to complain about in this course.",

            "body": "Edit Jan 2nd 2020:\n\nI have now completed 100% of this course.\n\nRating stays intact. Super course. I think Andrew should also get the credit for me completing this course 100%. I think this is the only course where I've wacthed and rewatched every single minute.\n\nAndrew sets a wonderful pace for the course. The challenge format really keeps the course engaging. You can't sit back and get bored as there is a challenge just around the corner.\n\nHe sets the expectations well at the beginning of the course. I think we keep hearing about someone learned webdev in 2 months and became a developer. Maybe someone did. But that is not my reality. It took me a long time to complete this course. But, you've got to find your own pace. It could take you one month or six months. You've got to learn at your own pace to be able to absorb the content.\n\nIt's not just about getting through the content. The key is absorbing the material and being able to apply it.\n\n------\n\nEarlier review when I was about 80% through the course:\n\nI have a lot to say about this course and just wanted to write my review as soon as possible so that anyone out there looking for an excellent teacher to teach you nodejs can stop their search right now and get started.\n\nAndrew deserves the Oscar for Udemy courses :) This is by far the best course I've taken on Udemy.\n\nHere are just some reasons you should take this course:\n\n1. The content is super updated. Seriously - every single video is relevant and everything that Andrew teaches works. No frustration and no figuring out stuff on your own.\n\n2. Challenge format. This is one of the simplest things that instructors can do to boost learning, but Andrew is the one to implement it very well. You cannot go too far in this course without getting your hands dirty and actually learning the material.\n\n3. Questions are answered. Given that this is one of the best selling courses on node on Udemy Andrew answers questions. I was having an issue in section 15 out of 18 sections and it would have been terrible to not get an answer at this point. But, Andrew came in and answered my question and my problem was solved this morning.\n\nI have a couple of suggestions to make your learning in this course better:\n\n1. Watch the videos at your own pace. Don't rush through the course. There were topics that were a little complex where I had to watch the video 2-3 times. Promises, async await, callback pattern. These are different from other programming languages.\n\n2. Don't be afraid to go back and rewatch videos.\n\n3. Take some time off and investigate things on your own. Maybe from some online resource to increase your learning.\n\nBut, the main thing is to stop your search for an excellent node course and jump in right now. That is why I wanted to leave this review here because I was in your spot just a month or so ago. And now I have this reference that i intend to keep coming back to.\n\nThank you Andrew for your hard work and wonderful teaching.\n\nRegards,\n\nTJ.",
