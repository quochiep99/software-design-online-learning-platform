There are a few concepts that I needed to find additional resources for (e.g. list comprehension) because they weren't explained beyond the definition. It would be really helpful to sometimes give multiple examples of when to use different functions/methods beyond what we used in the projects. Otherwise, the projects were great.",

The Instructor is a little too fast to keep up with at times but overall I have taken in a lot of knowledge and come away with some valuable experience, thank you very much!",
