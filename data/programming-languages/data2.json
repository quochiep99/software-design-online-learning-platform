For beginners the concepts are not pedagogical enough and for experts not deep enough. Also, there is too much reliance on the IDE that it sometimes gets confusing, e.i IDE inserts parameters 'to help' where the object methods is invoked.\n\nStudents that have knowledge in e.i SceneBuilder, SQL, thread management and design pattern usage will benefit from this course as the author shows how to 'put it all together'. The projects coded in the course are also very real world realistic (and interactive). Great for solidify aquired knowledge.",

I wish my college courses worked this way, they drag the same amount of material out over months.\" - Thomas Neal<br><br>\"I love this guy. I'm in school for java right now at a local college and I bought this course hoping it would help clarify the fuzzy areas of my coursework. There's no comparison. Every time I get lost in my textbook, I watch a couple more of these videos and I'm right back on track. He explains everything so perfectly. It sinks right in.\" - Kristen Andreani<br><br>\"Tim is a great instructor, I have more courses from him and all are great. This one really helped me with my understanding of Java from the very beginnings.
