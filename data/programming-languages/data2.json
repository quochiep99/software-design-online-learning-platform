After reading the reviews I decided to enroll in this course and now I am a lot more confident and skilled to code than I ever was. It is not only about programming in Java but also about learning problem-solving skills that will be useful on regular basis for a programming developer.\n\nSo, thank you (Tim and all team involved) for sharing your knowledge!

I wish my college courses worked this way, they drag the same amount of material out over months.\" - Thomas Neal<br><br>\"I love this guy. I'm in school for java right now at a local college and I bought this course hoping it would help clarify the fuzzy areas of my coursework. There's no comparison. Every time I get lost in my textbook, I watch a couple more of these videos and I'm right back on track. He explains everything so perfectly. It sinks right in.\" - Kristen Andreani<br><br>\"Tim is a great instructor, I have more courses from him and all are great. This one really helped me with my understanding of Java from the very beginnings. In fact, I was able to find a job as Java developer with the knowledge gained from this course, so I basically owe Mr. Buchalka my career\" - Daniel KubÃ¡nyi<br><br>Tim's mission is simple:&nbsp; to make a difference in your life by helping you to become a software developer. &nbsp;Tim does that through his Java, Python, C#, Spring Framework, and Android development courses.</p><p>When Tim started programming over thirty-five years ago, there was no online&nbsp;video training. &nbsp;</p><p>There was no \"easy\" way to learn. &nbsp;The Internet, in its current form, didn't exist, and as a result, Tim&nbsp;couldn't \"Google\" for help, or watch videos on Youtube.</p><p>After learning the hard way, Tim&nbsp;was determined to become the best teacher he could, and to make his training&nbsp;as painless as possible, so that you, or anyone else with the desire to&nbsp;become a software developer, could become one.</p><p>In between doing that, Tim&nbsp;spent the best part of those years as a professional software developer writing applications in Java and a variety of other languages. &nbsp;In addition, he spent many years with J2EE&nbsp;(as it was then known), now known as Java Enterprise Edition (JEE), designing and developing enterprise applications.</p><p>Tim is&nbsp;relatively unique, in that<strong>&nbsp;he is&nbsp;a professional, experienced software developer </strong>who also has <strong>exceptional teaching skills</strong>. &nbsp;<br><br>Many instructors have no work experience in the field. &nbsp;Make sure the person you trust with your education is a real expert with substantial previous professional experience.<br></p><p><strong>The bottom line for you is, when taking any of Tim's&nbsp;courses, is that&nbsp;you will learn the right way to do things from an expert, in the shortest possible amount of time.</strong></p><p>Tim's Java, Android, and Python courses, here on Udemy are of the highest quality as reviewed by his students. &nbsp;<strong> Ten's of thousands of students, just like you,&nbsp;have taken his&nbsp;classes,</strong> <strong>thousands have left glowing reviews,</strong> and many&nbsp;have gone on to full-time jobs, or consulting/freelancing opportunities after completing one of his&nbsp;courses.</p><p>Tim&nbsp;recently placed in the top ten Udemy instructors as voted for by his students and&nbsp;Udemy themselves. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>What does all of this mean for you?</strong></p><p>You can have full confidence that Tim's courses are of exceptional quality, and that he<strong>&nbsp;can teach you to become a software developer</strong> if you have the desire to become one.</p><p>Are you ready to start? &nbsp;You can get started today. &nbsp;No previous experience is necessary.</p><p>In 2020, video training is the quickest way to learn, and with Tim's experience and training, it is possible for you to become a software developer. &nbsp;You can do this.</p><p>Why not start today? &nbsp;Click one of his&nbsp;courses below, and watch his&nbsp;introductory video, to find out more about who he is&nbsp;and what he&nbsp;can offer you.</p>",
