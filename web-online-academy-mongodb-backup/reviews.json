  "body": "good introduction course for web development. Course cover various of web dev essentials such as html, css, javascript, nodejs, api , routes etc. Great support from the TA.\n\nHowever, the course is rather outdated and lots of technology is no longer support / use nowadays such as bootstrap 3 and jQuery, Javascript ES 5 only . Also lots of coding in backend and the tools are also out of date. It makes the TA keeps updating materials, new videos as a supplement to cover those parts and its a bit messy.\n\nI enjoy the course as Colt is really good at teaching. But I personally would not recommend this course simply because the outdated content. It is a course 5 years ago and I end up need to subscribe different courses to supplement those parts.\n\nI hope Colt and the team will revisit my comment and consider to update most of the content in the course include ES6 Javascript syntax, backend sessions etc.",

  "body": "Not as good as expected. Some of the materials are old and you get a feeling you´ll have to update yourself. The course needs a revamp to make it a 2020 course.\n\nThere are a lot of intermediate comments made by Colt´s assistant Ian that try to help but reflect the fact the course needs to be reviewed. I know that is a lot of work, but that would get you 5 star reviews.\n\nOn the other hand I feel disappointed with the fact that in the end, I wasn´t thought how to create my own website. The deployment part speaks briefly about how to deploy a project in Heroku. Nothing is said about what about if I already have my own website. Or if I want to create a new one. I wanted to learn coding to improve my business website. I have it in wordpress. I'm aware the backend language is php and I can use a control panel to manage it. Nothing in the course is said about this.\n\nSome of the contents are disconnected. At some point you'll be sent to Ian's youtube videos, then comes Ellie to speak about javascript more advanced issues, not announced.\n\nI got to the end and the YelpCamp project that was core to our learning through experience was incomplete. They give you a number of videos from youtube to try and give you the essentials. I only watched one by Ian on google maps, and it was so old I couldn´t follow wit the current Google API environment.\n\nThe promise I was given when I bought the course wasn´t delivered. This is not enough for me to create my own website or project.\n\nAll this said I also need to leave some comments of the positives of this course. First of all the Q&A team. I've asked a couple of things and responses were quick and helpful. On online environment that is very welcome.\n\nThe course is thorough. I think I now have the tools to go deeper into the different technologies and languages if I want.\n\nColt is very clear in his expositions. Some times speaks to quick for a foreigner like myself, but we have the magic of rewind to hear as many times as we wish.\n\nWith all considered this is probably, still one of the best and more complete courses online available on the subject. I feel tempted to search for others though.\n\nThere are many other positive aspects I haven´t focused on. All in all I think 3 stars is the rate applicable at this point in time.\n\nColt and team, please think about updating the materials, or even creating a new whole course.",

  "body": "Frustrating is how I would best describe this course. In the beginning course is alright. It just gets incredibly frustrating towards the end where almost everything is outdated. The slides beforehand are always nice - where it mentions the updated syntax, but having to follow through those videos with outdated syntax where we learned the updated syntax many many slides ago is just frustrating, confusing, and just plain annoying. This course was probably great 5 years ago, but these videos need to be updated properly for it to be truly effective. The few slides many moons ago, don't do this course any justice, and the fact that there are often so many things left out of the videos truly leaves me demotivated to finish the course. I always return to finish, but I can see these frustrations leaving many not wanting code again. Decent course for the price, Colt is a pretty good teacher and I would love to learn from him at one of his other bootcamps, but the material is lacking in 2020.",

The first half of the course that deals with frontend development is very comprehensive as Colt takes time to explain concepts.\n\nThe second half however left me a bit frustrated; the backend development felt more like bringing the puzzle pieces together rather than understanding the basic of puzzle. The course has given me a good idea of how node works, but I am unsatisfied with the approach taken: most of the time, when we included packages, it felt like we were doing so arbitrarily. On this front, there were too many minor things to take care of and remember; I am not sure if this is inherent to working with node, but it was left unclear.\n\nOverall, the course offers more than what I paid for it and I am happy with what I have learned from this course.\n\nThanks Colt!",

The final section \"where do you go from here\" could include some tips on setting up students own environment for doing web project on their own machines for practice purpose, which includes a webserver and required IDE.\n\nOverall, the course was great to follow and practice. Learnt a lot!!\n\nRegards, Tapan.",

Also, throughout the course, we built around 10 projects, in which we focused on the react and redux part, not on stylings, which I loved it since we had enough time to discuss all details of react and redux.

Few tidbits of JS and Jquery was added but it was easy to follow. The final bonus section on flexbox and css grid was not very useful. Few sections are however outdated and might need to be reworked. The ionicons library previously implemented with css no longer work the way it used to. The ionicons are now JS driven. This requires some changes in few sections.

Also at many places reference to eBook has been made which has been missing. It has been answered that in place of eBook website URL has been provided. Could not find all things in the website that has been mentioned. Many referenced websites have changed the way of functioning and some of them don’t even exist now.

For example, I had a leftover @model statement specifying the random movie view model, and when I first tried to do the section 2 exercise, I got a blizzard of errors that were hard to understand. He should give people a basic setup or send-off for exercises with a \"don't forget\" piece of advice or two. That would not compromise the challenge that he wants the student to face.",

Honestly, I bought also a different course but with an advance approach and see if I could follow it, but some of it was a bit confusing to me.

I didn't go for five stars though because there are some areas that I thought were badly explained and I had to go elsewhere for a lot of information (particularly around what prototypes actually are and how promises actually work). Also, it seems that so much of JS is passing parameters into functions, and defining those parameters using arguments wherever that function is called. This distinction between parameters and arguments never actually gets explained on this course: you have to figure it out for yourself. The final two projects were EXTREMELY well explained, and it would have been great if the whole course was explained to this level. Overall though, I'm really happy with what I got out of it.",

Yeah a JavaScript course without a mention of closures.\n\nNo word about apply, bind or call functions.\n\nHe used filter function late in lecture 98 in a wrong manner which just by luck worked for the example he was working on. So cannot even expect the explanation there.\n\nIncomplete coverage of the the spread operator.\n\nFor...of loop (without any introduction) was used for the first time in the lecture on sets in section 10.\n\nIn the last section, he just tells to download the webpack+babel setup from his GitHub profile without explaining how he created it.\n\nThe list is too long.",

  "body": "I struggled learning Javascript coming from a career with no programming skills needed or experience. I tried other videos and online courses and to me, it seemed like they were made from the perspective that people had previous programming experience and wanted to learn how to program with Javascript. The focus was mainly on just how to write functions, arrays, and objects and not seeing any results of this outside of logging things on a console. These lessons for the first time showed me how JS can manipulate the DOM, methods for targeting HTML in a webpage, creating OOP, modules, patterns, and lots more so I finally could see what JS was doing when related to working on webpages for front-end work. The small projects are super helpful, and helped me to really understand the language while both coming together and in the final product. I will definitely be revisiting these videos for practice and test how much more I can do independently as I progress.",

Her lessons and course exercises are structured in such a way that it is easy to understand, without being too slow or too fast-paced to follow along with. She breaks down really complex concepts into simple, understandable chunks. As icing on the cake, her sense of humor is delightful!\n\nThis course not only demystifies Swift and XCode, but also teaches really important concepts like the Model/View/Controller pattern and Github. Good lord, THANK YOU Angela for including Git in this tutorial. It's ridiculous how many coding courses Ive taken with no mention of it at all.\n\nMy only problems with this course are that sometimes the audio cuts and repeats, or sometimes she dives into using a concept that she has not yet explained and then goes back to explain it in a later lesson. ALSO- I would recommend grabbing the latest version of the course for iOS 13 if you can, because some things are out of date in this course.\n\nOther than that, I have no complaints. Angela is truly awesome and if you have the discipline to get through the course, you will learn a ton even in the first 20 hours. My only other wish is that there would be some bonus lectures on NFC encoding but I can understand why its omitted since you need an iPhone X or later plus NFC cards/wristbands to read and write NFC with an app.",

I waited a little too long to start it, so some of the information is outdated, but with a little extra research I've been able to figure out the current ways to do things. The lessons are relatively simple, but the challenges are fun to figure out, and there's no worry if you can't do it, as the explanations are always clear. Definitely a great starting point for someone who hasn't done app development. It might be harder for someone who hasn't programmed in java before.",

The project replicates the app and puts to use all the skills students have learned in the preceding lectures, but I'm sorry if you felt it wasn't comprehensive enough. The course is a little older now, which if why I use parser in database, but I'll take your feedback on board. Thanks, and happy coding.",

This means, more information is packed in these 60 hours of lectures.\n\n- MANY times I was like, \"what`s going on?\" because the explanation style is: \"coding on screen, telling what the code does\". This is master class, yes, not a definitive course of lectures, but more visual material (e.g. illustrating how different parts of Android ecosystem work) would be of great help. Tables with app structure helped a lot, but there are just a few of them.\n\n- Course has a cliffhanger \"we will make app settings in the next video\" and there`s no next video, it is the end of the course. (as of 31.07.2020). I hope it will be finished.\n\nConclusion: I would recommend this course to any person who is gonna be Android developer, though not as a first, \"introduction\" course.",

But others might think different.\n\nHowever really good challenges throughout the course to do it yourself",

  "body": "ating: 1.0 out of 5\n2 months ago\n\nI want to start by saying I have always been good at analytical thought processing. I was always good at math, so while I'm new to programming it's not something I find to be inherently difficult or abstract. Also, I have gotten through most of this course already so it's not like I started a few videos, didn't like them, and quit. I've been pushing through and intend to finish the course but at this point I can see that certain things are not going to change towards the end.\n\nThe structure of this course is just horrible. Apparently they are working on a revision which I believe should help to some degree as it became blatantly obvious when I got past the revised portion and into the original course material.\n\nThe first problem I have with the structure is that there is very little thought put into prioritization. It seems like there is just as much time and emphasis put on things that are trivial as there is on the core concepts that you are trying to learn. For instance, he literally spends about 1.5 hours on time zones. If I want to become an expert on time zones I can look that up on my own time. I'm trying to learn programming here, sure time zones are a valuable thing to know how to implement, but they are hardly essential to the main goal of learning how to program.\n\nSecond, there is not very much drilling of core concepts. There are really no big projects that help you to put what you learn into practice. Other courses I've taken in Javascript, HTML/CSS, have had projects along the way so you get comfortable with what you've learned so far before moving on.\n\nThird, this seems like almost as much of a trouble shooting class as a teaching class. I understand that trouble shooting is VERY important in programming. However, the lessons are so often interrupted with trouble shooting tips that you kind of lose focus on the main reason most people take the class, learning to do things correctly. This is probably a feature that may be beneficial to people who are intermediate Python programmers, but for those of us who are beginners as the course advertises it is meant for, the trouble shooting really can be distracting from just learning the correct ways of doing things. Might be beneficial to have a separate trouble shooting section at the end of the course instead of constantly interrupting the study flow of students showing them how to deal with this and that along the way that really shouldn't be happening if they are writing their code correctly. Usually this occurs in the middle of a video, but sometimes is just inserted into a section as a random separate video that is not necessarily just applicable to that sections material. For instance, halfway through the SQL/Database section we just stop and get into 1.5 hours worth of videos about exception handling. I get that exception handling is applicable to SQL/databases, but it is far from being exclusively applicable to that area of Python, so why stop in the middle of SQL/databases, why not just add it in it's own section or at least at the beginning or end of the database section instead of stopping right in the middle?\n\nFourth, trial and error. I get that programming entails a lot of trial and error, however, when you're new at something you'll make enough typos and other errors all on your own. These videos were made seemingly with little prior plan for how goals would be achieved. The instructor seems to be processing how he's going to do things as he does them. This leads to students sometimes being told to type code that doesn't execute correctly and then having to adjust it along with the instructor after they've already spent time typing a bunch of stuff out. Also a lot of things that may not necessarily cause code not to execute but that the instructor tells you to do it one way and then halfway through just realizes that the way he had done it is not the best way to do it and has you change it.\n\nFifth, similar names. Throughout the course the instructor will use a similar names for multiple things in a video or even the same name with the only difference being one start with a capitalized letter and one without or one is plural and one is not, etc etc. This makes in difficult to follow what is supposed to be going where as you're writing code. Am I referring to a class or a variable? etc, etc. It also makes it less obvious what previously written code is referring to as you're watching the video, is this code referring back to the Class, to a variable, to a function? May seem obvious to an intermediate student but to a beginner it makes the learning process more difficult. It also makes it unnecessarily difficult to catch errors when your code doesn't execute properly.\n\nFinally, too much going on in a single video. To be fair, this does seem to be something they are addressing in the up coming revised version. But very often in this course you will be working on a concept, you'll learn how to do it, and then rather than leaving that video finished and having that in your mind as to how that concept/process should be done, he'll continue the video and have you erase what you've done to show you another way of doing it, and then another way of doing it, and then another way of doing it. By the end you're kind of like \"what the hell was I supposed to be learning to begin with?\". Probably better to just start a new video, create a new file, copy the code from the other file, and then change it to learn another variation of how to do something.

I would imagine that it would not be as difficult for an intermediate student to follow, but might still be just as frustrating.",

There is some part more interesting to me than the others.\n\nHowever, it's very nice to learn and see what Python can do. All modules in this course help building your python skill as a programmer.\n\nThe apps that we made are proper in term of complexity, difficulty, and time limit. This course really get your hands dirty. It's a real learning by practicing course and not simply syntax learning.\n\nI also like instructor's manner. He is quite funny and easy to listen to. You will see many errors happening here and there in this course. Personally, I think it's not a bad thing because you see how to fix it (or google) and be familiar with the exceptions which is part of programming job..fixing bugs or try out solutions.\n\nLast but not the least is Q&A support, I would say it's second to none. Course Assistant is super supportive and respond in short time. He does pay attention to help and give advices to students.\n\nThank you Ardit for such a big amazing course and David for your kind support to students.\n\nI look forward for The Python Mega Course: Season2!",

The course also leads you to an amazing and supportive Discord community, where you can discuss your code, share your progress, find help and coding buddies. They have also Github community, where you can work with others or on your own on open source projects and maybe share these contributions on your resume. I'll be coming back to this course to complete the 100 Python exercises.\n\nThanks very much Andrei for this course! You're saying it's important for you to provide value to others and to the world. I think that you've definitely achieved that via your courses and community! It's a great benefit for the world to have you existing! :)\n\nAlso, special thanks to the teaching assistant William, who was all the time with me throughout my journey with this course and always helped me out, whenever I was stuck with difficult, or silly situations, and took the time to clarify for me concepts, which I had troubles with at first!\n\nI can't really describe all the amazing features of this course in such a review, but there are many more.

The course should be improved: 1) REST API Development is way too brief and not as detailed as the Web Dev course. 2) The course did not show how to create python application with online sql database 3) Data Science and Machine learning sections are too brief. Please expand Machine Learning and cover more concepts. 4) Please add Pytest(under Automation Testing section), Python with nonsql database, Python GUI programming(basics), Python Concurrency and Threads, Python linear and non-linear data structures, Python for Parallel and distributed computing, Python Stream Processing. The course rating is 4 b/c nothing is said about how to do python app with sql database and rest api should be discussed in much more detail. The overall Python course is very good - above average.",

  "body": "I work as a solutions developer in an IT firm with 2 yrs exp. I am not much of an easily-convinced person, but its safe to say that Andrei is the best instructor till now that I have come across on the internet..and mind that I have taken a lot of online courses from various sources!! Its not very common to expect Lehman-level teaching, right from basics, to accommodate both pro-to newbie students with zero coding/computing background, from a senior dev turned instructor. The best part is that he shares his way of thinking and working around with syntaxes and topics etc, and how to figure out solutions from internet and what should be the approach. Personally, I find this part one of the most overwhelming while developing stuff. Now, about the course-- The course syllabus is quite comprehensive, including well-explained Dev env setup videos and tools. Both Andrei and his videos literally walk through every bit of setting up env, along with discussing bits which may be encountered in case of other versions/OS/softwares. The course content is well-distributed into sections, with well-timed videos of short durations, which ends before it starts to go over the top of the head! William, the teaching assistant was quite helpful too, in promptly answering all queries wherever one gets stuck, in very less time. Finally, it was a great course to start learning Python and go on to specialize in it. I had some experience with learning web-dev online earlier but left it midway because it was too vast and was getting too much to understand and master. Now with this course having done, I feel much more interested and confident in taking a web-development or Front-end dev course. Thanks Andrei...looking forward to more of your courses !!!!",

I was so engaged into it and excited about learning stuffs for almost last 4 weeks that made me confident enough and gave a better developer experience.

  "body": "This course is not what I expected at all. Yes, Max does in fact cover all the necessary topics that he says that he will cover, but when it came to getting unstuck it was hard not to be disastisfied with the lack of answers provided by the teaching assistants. There are also problems that prior students pointed out 2-3 years ago that were NEVER corrected in the module. So you have students in 2020 still running into issues that students in 2017 told Max and Adam to update years ago. While the TA is why I paid for the course(just the ability to get some feedback), responses to problems were pretty much consistent, \"use my source code\", \"have you compared your source code to my code\" and was no really help at all. I stopped coding a month ago because I was stuck on an issue that I couldn't solve in the lecture, I came back and see that new tickets have been added to the Q&A resource tab - looks like this problem has STILL not been resolved. You even have prior students telling Max and Adam that the module should be updated to reflect the answers they have found after hours and hours of extensive troubleshooting. So there are sections where students can easily be guided but no guidance has been provided. But I guess we should all be thankful that DenoJS has just been added to the course. How about fixing the bugs/really taking a look at what students are having issues/reteaching some of the areas that are problematic and then focus on pushing out new content? It must be a slap in the face for students to spend hours and hours of debugging and coming up with solutions only for Max to add new content, but never address the bugs and problems in the module or the code. I also didn't like the constant refactoring. If I was stuck in one section, it made it harder to determine where the problem was because Max had already started on a new topic in A NEW SECTION. The course comes out super disorganized, and I cannot image that I put in wayyyy too much time into this course thinking that it was going to change somehow. The amount of hours that's needed in the course doesn't make sense when it can be taught rather simply and straightforward. There were also some sections that a quick Google search provided clear and succint answers to that Max explained in a rather difficult way.",

I watched the whole course using x1.5 playback speed because Colt speaks a bit slow (but I guess it's fine for the complete newbies in the world of programming). The only thing that annoyed me was the Scrapy module video, to me it did not explain the topic in satisfactiorial profoundity. Apart from that, it's really cool that there are two sections at the end that have been added after the course publication. Definitely recommend it!",

Having completed the earlier R Programming courses from Kirill Eremenko, I obtained a fairly basic handle on the core R language (having no experience beforehand), and felt ML would be a good next challenge. I committed to complete the entire course - which is quite comprehensive - and I'm quite glad I did as I now feel as if I have enough of a handle on building up these models and can at least speak intelligently about them. The coding skills of Hadelin de Ponteves are quite impressive and there were many little tricks and takeaways that can be applied elsewhere in your work. I do have one important complaint and that is regarding working with the H2o platform in the ANN lecture. There are many, many complaints on this topic which have not been addressed by the author(s). I came to the solution after much research and it involves installing a compatible version of Java JDK on your machine. The documentation is found on the H2o website. As of today, H2o does not support the most recent version of Java (15) so you will need to download an earlier version from the Java archive. Installing/uninstalling is a bit of a pain, but good luck.",

  "body": "The coverage of ML theory was very shallow. The recommended companion book for the course is ISLR. I purchased a course so that I could receive multimedia instruction, which should be the best method to learn from. However, you end up being directed to many third party websites or books if you want any depth of understanding. Most of the ML part of the course is simply learning what to type into a Jupyter Notebook in order to get a very basic ML algorithm to run. The Big Data and Spark w/ Python section is a complete disaster. As far as I could ascertain, there was no attempt to show how to tie Spark into an ML project. I came away not even knowing how to utilize Spark for an ML project. Also that section is outdated, and once again you are directed to another website for \"up-to-date\" instructions on how to install Spark on AWS. Unfortunately, those instructions were outdated too. I couldn't even get Spark to run the action methods on my AWS E2C service. It was a complete waste of time. Overall, the course is just ok. The instructor seems knowledgeable, and very courteous. Nevertheless, I am leaving an honestly review in hopes that he sees what to improve, and so that others honestly know what to expect. It is not a waste of time or money, but I was expecting more. The instructor's Python Boot Camp course was awesome, and that is what set the expectation for me. Unfortunately, this course did not live up to expectations.",

I feel that Jose is one of the only people that is teaching these subjects in a fairly fast way that is understandable. I enjoyed the course and I feel that it educated me. The only thing that I would improve is to add a few lectures about some common topics that the course didn't address like how to pick a machine learning algorithm, how to choose the variables for the models and how to explore the data. I mean, all of this was mentioned in few words throughout the course but I feel that these topic should have a bit more emphasis and some explanations around, at least some rules of thumb or general thinking direction and not just 'I always like to do this check when I start exploring the data'\n\nOverall a good course and I feel that it was worth the money.",

The approach to machine learning section is gradual as well, providing the necessary theoretichal tool to study and go deep into the math beyond the algorithm and the lybraries explained. The course mantains an application-focused and practical approch, consenting to immediately understand how to apply the presented tools. The final projects at each session allow to immediatly practice and test yourself, also providing the opportunity to build a small personal portfolio. It definitly worth the price I paid, for both the quality of the contents and the supporting service. Definitely reccommended to beginner and intermediate Python users who want to learn Machine Learning. This course will not automatically convert you into a Data Scientist.

  "body": "So I just finished this course today. The lecture contents was long and exhaustive. I can tell the instructors had put in a lot of efforts and time to make the lectures interesting. The total hours for this course is 29 hours, and i think it took me like 60 hours due to stopping, replaying, stopping again, and taking notes etc. Overall, I think they could have done better. Some suggestions I think this course could improve on:\n\n1. python - when you introduce the codes there should have been some markups with arrows and bullet points stating what that code does and when you run the code show us with markings what it does. Most of the time the instructor will get overly excited when he runs the code and not explaining what's going on. Also when you add a code, to add some columns show us where it will end up and mark them on the videos. More bullet point notes the better. Sometimes you introduce new codes and don't exactly explain what it does and it gets so confusing. And you also copy and paste codes from somewhere and expect us to understand what you did as it went over my head. Because this Python part is so important to all of us learning for the first time, and eventually we'll get into Data Science in our careers one day, this section needs to be improved on so we all can better understand what's going on.\n\n2. TF1 vs TF2 - I don't think there's any need to go comparing both of these as TF2 is current and mostly what we are trying to learn now right? Also getting TF2 to install was a nightmare as some people had the same issue.\n\n3. Intro. to the field of Data Science - These lectures are way too long. You have 8 sections describing this and could have sum up in a few lectures stating what it does and the types of careers one can go into with the type of skill sets. Sorry but I was about to fall asleep.\n\n4. Mathematics - Maybe need to add basic Calculus\n\n5. Probability and Stats - it was long but alright.\n\n6. Other items to add - SQL and Big Data, just the basic stuffs and how to integrate these into Python, and discuss what software we'll need to learn etc.\n\n7. Lecture Videos - Quality could be better as the video seems a bit blurry or low quality.\n\n8. Instructors - As most students stated that the instructors voice sounded like a robot and not a real human teaching and I totally agree. I won't drill into too much but I find the instructor who was teaching the Case Study for the Absenteeism (Preprocessing) does a good job as he uses markups to indicate how the code was executed and carried out.\n\nI did enjoyed it and learned some skills along the way.

Let me take this opportunity to clarify the reasons for my great enjoyment of the course:\n\n1. First, the content is very easy to understand.\n\n2. Realistic approach, balanced theories and practice\n\n3. Extremely eye-catching design and presentation. I mean the way the content is delivered on the screen is very attractive.\n\n4. Martin and Iliya are ACTUALLY TEACHING, not just repeating what is on the screen as some other teachers do. They usually flux the screen with tons of words, and just read what is there, which is both boring and does not make much sense.\n\n5. Great and timely response in the Q&A section of the course, which is very helpful, especially to novice learners like me.\n\n6. The course has been continuously updated since its appearance on Udemy, which shows that Martin and Iliya do care about the quality of their work.\n\nThe list may go on and on. However, the most AMAZING thing to me (and I do believe it is also amazing to other learners) is the VOICE!!! Both teachers have a voice so amazing, clear, and energetic that I could hardly get bored with the lesson. By the way, I love your proper pronunciation and intonation so much, which helps learners to understand the lesson a great deal.\n\nAll in all, this is the best course I have ever learned online, and Martin and Iliya are two of the most wonderful teachers/instructors/Professors in the field I've ever known.\n\nI hope Martin and Iliya have a chance to read this review as well.\n\nPlease make more and more such courses for us, Matin and Iliya!\n\nWish you all the best!\n\nDanh Nguyen",

I uninstalled, and installed different times, but I though in the towel, and searched UDEMY for R training, and found 3 courses by you, and after the very first chapter R and R Studio was installed. I am going to complete Python, Deep Learning, and another one of his courses before getting back to finishing the Power BI training. I like your method of training too much to stop right now.

One thing, however, that was nagging at me throughout the entirety of the course was whether I had the proper preparation. This course is listed as the first of the AI Engineer path on the SuperDataScience website. Therefore, I thought it would be the most appropriate course with which to begin, but the course may not be self-contained. There are many areas during which the instructors refer to another course (e.g., Machine Learning A-Z) and that worried me as to whether I should've taken it before starting this one. Nonetheless, I followed through pretty well, and you should too if you have previous experience in Python.\n\nOne thing I would advise the instructors to do is to keep these courses as self-contained as possible and not even mention materials from other courses if there are no prerequisites. That or simply include the necessary modules in the Annex.",

There is room for improvement in explaining certain concepts as to Why, When, and How are they used. While explaining a few code constructs, I noticed the same could be done in 10 other ways but it wasn't clearly conveyed as to why a particular logic is chosen over the other. Overall, I do appreciate the attempt by your team to make things as simple as possible and I expect your team to come up with an even deeper explanation of concepts and code alike.",

I especially liked his use of many small video lessons, which makes the course easy to consume and also makes it easy to use the course material as a reference later. He comes across as very approachable, dealing with typos and short-term memory lapses just like the rest of us.\n\nThe only flaw, if you can call it that, is that occasionally he re-explains a point too many times or gives more hypothetical examples than necessary, which can drag out the lesson. But overall I'd rather have an instructor err on that side than that opposite.\n\nThis course has given me the confidence to dig deeper into Data Science. I'm heading on to more courses, but most importantly I feel ready to start practicing on real projects.",

Although it may not be very technical and doesn't dive very deep into things like ML or any of the programming language data scientists can work in, I understand it wasn't designed that way (in fact Kirill talks about that in one of the starting tutorials). There are separate courses which cover those topics and I'm sure going to try them out. I really enjoyed the data prep section, where the whole ETL process may seem tedious at first, but Kirill provides almost 100% bulletproof methods and blueprints to go through it as quickly and efficiently as you can. Also, big thanks for presentation section, didn't see any other course cover this topic yet.",

  "body": "This course provides a great breadth of coverage on data science concepts, including peripheral topics seldom covered elsewhere (e.g. hyperparameter tuning, ethics and handling missing data). In terms of suggestions for improving the course further, here are a couple of areas for suggested inclusion:\n\n- model explainability for scenarios where dimensionality reduction is utilised (e.g. PCA) or emergent behaviour is observed (e.g. deep learning). This is because explaining how a model arrived at a particular prediction is a critical topic for gaining business confidence from a product owner/business stakeholder.\n\n- when multiple models are feasible to address a business problem, which considerations determine model selection (unless the recommendation is to try all feasible models and use the model that provides the best results, similar to the final project's approach).\n\n- model drift, the factors that cause it, and how to address it (e.g. model retraining)\n\nAs a suggestion for an advanced follow-up course, it'd be great to be able to explore the underlying mathematical theory of the machine/deep learning algorithms explored in this course. This is something I haven't yet seen elsewhere on Udemy, except for regression models.\n\nA separate more Deep Learning course would also be beneficial for exploring topics such as how different gradient descent optimisation algorithms work and considerations for when each kind of algorithm should be used.",

The first AI, to build the self-driving car, was quite a difficult one to start with, considering no experience in the field. But eventually, you'll get along. The second one, Doom, was absolutely awesome and that is the one I enjoyed the most. That feeling when I saw my AI beat Doom is unexplainable :D. The third one, Breakout, is way too difficult, even the tutor mentioned that it is a bonus.\n\nOne feedback I'd like to give is that u could include a small intro to Pytorch and the functions of the same used to make the AIs in the course. Since this course has no requirements (but actually requires knowing PyTorch basics), the above could have been included.\n\nAnd explaining the structure of the AI beforehand dramatically before moving on to coding can make the coding part more intuitive, especially when starting off and not having any idea of what's ahead.\n\nAnd this course has a good support team. Never had to wait for more than a day for a reply. There are many topics that more than 20 people are equally doubtful about, so rather than asking the same question again and replying for the same, I'd recommend including the same in the course.\n\nNevertheless, the course was good overall. I took this course as a starter, and now I know the key areas I have to focus on to get a strong foundation in the field. And can boast about making an AI beat Doom. :D",

It will give you the right intuition and kickstart about understanding and working of AI but it won't make you confident enough on using or building your own AI. It has really good in detail theory part but implementation could have made simpler and easy. At some points so many concepts come up and you just lose interest and try to pace up with the code without understanding what's actually happening. I will consider it as more of a guide than a course to learn AI. But instructor has actually put a lot of efforts that can be seen. Secondly in Doom game project, if you're running windows 10 then probably either you have to go for a dual boot or use a virtual machine to run your training model which is something I actually don't like... There should have been something which should be compatible with all kinds or not if all atleast (Windows+Mac+Linux) OS. Thank you very much for this course!",

Sometimes it is even funny\n\nAs for the practical usage, it is nice to put hands on deep learning libraries interface, but it would be much nicer to really build couple of applications that perform the real world action. To start with some model, to improve results by changing model and/or approach, to achieve really good scores and make something working. Here you basically make some that works normal at most, stop at the model selection level and get recommendation to improve it somehow yourself. Ok, not problem. But maybe there should be some benchmarking from author? Maybe exercises shall not be at the beginning, like now \"Code everything yourself after theoretical part, you shall do that\", but after practical part, like \"Now your got your hands on code, so make it better in this and this way and we see later how you performed\"\n\nAlso, it is annoying when source code is updated, but video is not. So when you try to code with author you almost always run into simple errors just because a lot of stuff has changed since than, I mean the sintax. So, the options are to spend time checking libraries' docs to fix the error or to look the source code, which is not nice.",

  "body": "Definitely a decent course to get started with Unity Engine, I quite liked the project-based learning approach offered in this course! I'd like to list out some downsides of the course where one of them is quite a major issue in my opinion:\n\n- This course is for complete beginners, in terms of both Unity & C#. Therefore, there are a lot of programming concepts that lack throughout the course, they always prefer to stay on the surface when it comes to coding. I just wish that there would've been a massive section that just focuses on C#, then we could've used some advanced code techniques in our games, or this course wouldn't have had any intentions to teach C#, and be just about Unity. But this is the way they had to go in order to sell more, which I honestly and completely understand, but I hope they don't mind me breaking a half point because of it :)\n\n- Some of the content is way too repetitive, they could've taught some new concepts instead of spending that much time on the same things over and over again!\n\nDespite all that, I quite enjoyed the course and looking forward to having an intermediate-advanced Unity 2D course offered by them!",

Again I still found the course challenging, I even felt like throwing one time so the difficulty it's okay.\n\nLastly:\n\nThanks for this work, Rick & Ben.",

This is the very definition of active learning, as it constantly challenges you and invite you to take action!

Additionally, almost each video has a challenge that you are very much encouraged to attempt even if you think you can't. The variation of challenges is also well constructed as they have different difficulty levels according to the game you are working on.\n\nEvery single thing you learn, you will apply (or be challenged to) more than couple of times and in a different flavor as per the current project, so the repetition will help solidify and fill in any gaps.\n\nFinally, everything the long course description mentions is accurate and covered if not added upon. I can say that it certainly exceeded my expectations and left me wanting to take all of their other courses.\n\nIf you are wondering which Unity 2D course you want to enroll in from the hundreds available then this is a no-brainer.",

Give this thing a value of 5.f. Now call ThisFunctionYouWouldHaveNeverBeenAbleToFigureOut, make sure to include its header 'YadaYada/GoodLuckWhenYoureOnyourOwn.h'. Okay, great. Let me show you something else now.\") You guys really did a great job actually teaching instead of showing how to just copy code. I really love that there's almost always a challenge in each lecture, and that's honestly the thing that no one else seems to do.

Ben is a fantastic instructor and I naturally gravitated to him. He takes the pain-staking time of explaining things, preparing diagrams, workflows, etc. The pacing is spot on and content is beautifully crafted. Don't expect that now in Section 5.\n\nIt is a real shame. If you can pick this course up cheap, maybe give it a try, but use the old content if you can.\n\nIt pain's me to leave a negative review like this, it really does.

Not all teachers do this. Thanks a lot! God Bless! EDIT: Finished the course and it was awesome! Highly recommend it! Audio was good could clearly hear the instructors. Content was nice progression even tho i wanted to skip ahead to the first person shooter section. Instructors give challenges and quizzes which helped me learn a lot and most times i enjoyed them. Most assets are provided for free which is a huge plus and if they weren't provided they were easy to find for free on the asset store. The only problem i had in the course is not the instructors fault but Unitys. They changed the Post-Processing and ProGrid tools in the newer version of Unity so it was harder to find and harder to install properly. With that being said i was able to complete this course with Unity 2019.4.1 and later upgraded to Unity 2019.4.4 and was able to follow along nicely! Thanks again Ben and Rick!",

  "body": "Very good course for beginners. The tutor explained the basics very well. We started off with introduction to the UI, which many find intimidating in Unreal. However, the tutor explained it in a very structured, easy to use and with a case study that helped us to relate to what we were doing.\n\nFrom the very beginning we directly jumped to a 2.5D game development which introduced us to Blueprints in much more details. We learned how to code for event capturing, movements through Blueprints.\n\nThe difficult part I felt during the entire course was the lack of detailed explanations provided for some difficult topics like material manipulation, collision and a few other things which appeared to be simplistically covered and we rushed through them. Another case was with understanding of Animation Montages in the second game example. Those are fairly complex topics, which should have been given due importance with slightly more detailed explanations. We, ourselves, would need to do some additional research on these topics to completely grasp it. This is not essentially bad, as it makes you self reliant and forces you to explore other support channels, something you'd need to use a lot after your course. Also, some of the interface elements appeared different due to the version difference. You will have to struggle and find some of the options, which are visible by default in the older versions - for instance a basic element like Modes Panel.\n\nOne suggestion I would like to give is that at the beginning of each chapter, the tutor can provide a vision of what we are going to achieve by the end of this chapter visually, and not just orally. This would help us to visualize and follow exactly what we are doing and why we are doing. Since this practice was not followed, invariably, you'll have to watch each chapter at least twice - once to understand what is being done, and second to implement and understand why and how its done. Thus, you can easily consider the course duration to be easily over 80 hours!",

It would have been great if this class went into the expected structure of a game Unreal is build for and some of the programming semantics.

I believe this course helped address (to some degree) both by known unknowns and unknown unknowns.\n\nUE4 is massive, but I feel ready to really dig into my own projects. I believe I have enough of a vocabulary now to find answers to my own questions and quickly apply it to my projects w/o watching 5 YouTube videos first :-)\n\nI recommend this course for beginners. However, like others have commented on this course, there are many instances where I felt like certain topics were glossed over. That's really, really frustrating for a noob.\n\nAnother thing that was a bit frustrating was when he would start inserting BP nodes, and I'm thinking \"where are we going with this\"? I know Chris knows where he's going but as a learner, I like to know where I'm being led.\n\nOverall a good course. Good job.",

I have no problem following along and have been inspired in the process. All in all this has been the way to go for me instead simply You tubing. The reason being that i never so far have not gotten 35 minutes into a tutorial and had the instructor tell me that he has created this whole other asset in another tutorial that we should just know how to make to complete the tutorial. From the very beginning you create every asset that you will use in the project besides Meshes which are provided. I would recommend this to anyone who is not afraid of work and knowing how the sausage is made.\n\nBe healthy and have fun!",

So time passes by when he teaches. My favorite part would be the design spreadsheet when Rick says \"here is the spreadsheet. Boom. Bye\" that I think was one of the best Rick moments.\n\nNext, though Sam is a new addition he fits into Ben's shoes quite nicely. I liked his lectures not as much Rick's though. His lectures do seem a bit of a drag sometimes but at certain times he blew my mind as when I learned that Interfaces can be used to revert Dependencies and remove dependency cycles. I thought they were useless when I learned about them in my college lectures. Thank you Sam!! For blowing my mind. Also this is a bit of personal advice/bias, so do take this with a pinch of salt, but do try to spice up your lectures with probably how you screwed up in code (if you do) before recording a lecture so that we also get a chuckle and learn oh yeah that could happen toooo so that 12 mins and above lectures don't feel boring.\n\nAlso thank you for using Vscode as I would have no idea how to edit scripts without Visual Studio on linux.\n\nAlso I missed Ben dearly. It would nice if he showed up as a cameo. I would have thrown my hands in the air in exhilaration.\n\nBrain is an amazing Teaching Assistant. He answered all of my stupid questions as well showed me the way to things that I wanted to put in my game that were out of the scope of this course.\n\nFinal Verdict.\n\nIf the basic unity course was Mass Effect, then this course was Mass Effect 2. A masterpiece. (Not sure if the analogy worked though.) The basic course too was a masterpiece. But this felt more expansive. And last but not the least, Thank you!!",

I would like from you to read this one carefully, I put a lot of effort on this review not for nothing, for the better. ❤️?\n\nWhen I started the course it was really understandable, easy, and flowing, but unfortunately I found it quite unfriendly as I moving forward, here is why. Don't get me wrong this course is great, but somethings are a little bit overwhelming because of the explanation, for example: I asked and mentioned it a lot but I thing that if you would put more effort explaining about the dictionary part (The lookUpTable) it could be great. It was really frustrating that I could not understand it, So I just gave up and leave the course for about a month. The challenges are a bit unclear, Please give us more clues that we can use, or explain a little bit more what are we really trying to do (I really struggled with understanding what we are trying to do while Sam gave me the challenges, so I had to guess... and hope that it is right). The help in the Q&A was great though, Shout out to Brian that was there just in time, and he is really trying to help and understand the problem.\n\nI learned a lot from this course and I became from a beginner programmer to more advanced and it even pushed me to learn more about the programming world thanks to you guys, please take notice about what I've said. Thank you. Great work!",

I understand that it is geared towards beginner coders and so it is unreasonable to introduce complicated concept early on. But I would have like to see some part of the code \"revisited\" with an approach like, \"Ok now that we know better code practice, let us refactor this section of the code into a nice pattern to ensure maintenance efficiency and extensibility\".\n\nBasically, I would like to see a more advance course where we develop solid system with strong architecture with explanations about the design decisions.\n\nSo to better explain my thought, I'll make an analogy. If this class is about developing a Prototype of an RPG, it does a good job I think, I would like to see a class about how to turn a good prototype into a managable product.\n\nCheers,",

Sam provides an excellent end-to-end solution, explanation, and coding challenges to get you set up for combat, movement, and a lot of other features for the RPG game! You can sense the passion behind each instructor as they provide clear and precise examples to every feature and line of code. The best thing about these courses is the challenges and I encourage students to use them even as an experienced software engineer the challenges keep me on my toes.

However, I reached a point where it is difficult to progress with my own forces. Indeed, the web is full of courses and tutorials for Unity beginners, but it is really hard to find something for intermediate level. But, this course exists, and it is awesome! I definitely learnt a lot of techniques that I could not figure out on my own (maybe in a lifetime), and which are super-useful to build an RPG, or a more complex game which goes beyond few simple features. The teachers are fantastic, explain everything, and build the code together with you. Moreover, whatever question you have, you can ask in the questions section, and the dev team answers always in few hours.

All his lectures are pretty straightforward and easy to understand, there are no uses of fancy vocabulary, no manner of difficult grammar usage, perfect for anyone practically. The most impressive thing about David Nixon's explanation is that he goes on to give a clear understanding and clarity of even the tiniest of things (like importing files by dragging it from another folder to UE4 content browser or exporting audio files in Audacity) that may seem trivial to some but in actuality it's helping a lot of people!\n\nBased on my experience and learning patterns from David's lectures, I will definitely rate this course a 10/10 !",

If you find that approaching a large and powerful engine such as unreal is easier when you first have a firm grip on the basics then this course will be just right for you.\n\nAfter this, you'll find the other courses on Unreal Engine much easier to jump into as you will already understand how and why the engine works.\n\nIt's well taught, topics are concise without too much fluff and i was able to go through it fairly quickly and much of it will serve as a great refresher i'm sure when working on my own projects.\n\ni recommend it highly.\n\nThank you David.",

Also, this course approach is more \"do this and that, click here and there\" than \"do this because of ...\". I think this course would have been more helpful if explanations were while you making a game, rather than before real action. Also, the tutor's speech seems to be recorded with different microphones, and therefore the sound often suddenly changes back and forth. Ocassionly there is loud background noise. However, tutor himself seems to be knowledgeable, but unfortunately, the course quality feels poor. But this is just my personal experience, it might feel different for you.",

The parts that are present in pretty much everything. Things as simple and important as being unable to trigger the animation to clear an obstacle unless you have a certain item.\n\nUltimately udemy has to compete with youtube, and in my experience, the youtube alternatives to this commercial are version-outdated and don't work on important constituent parts first.\n\nThe problem is the Timelines-themed videos halfway through the course.\n\nThey're utterly incomprehensible to a layman. the narrator simply says what he's doing and never why, how it works, why it needs to be done, how it's interfacing with anything, etc.",

In fact in the last lecture He gets an error in the editor which he completely ignores and didn't even tell us what it was and how to fix it. In my case I use 4.26p with VS2019. I ended up with many errors on things like an Array error, or some classes don't even exist, warnings about debricated functions.. and few more. Luckily I know Blueprint so I tried to fix as much as I could but it would be great if the lecturer actually keeps this great course up to date.\n\nFinally, I really would have loved this course if the lecturer actually communicate with us and answer our questions.\n\nOverall, great course but be ready to fix a lot of problems yourself.

  "body": "Excellent course, definitely recommend it. Some constructive criticism is that it's clear the re-do of the course has improved the code quality a lot, as it does feel like the code in the sections which haven't been updated yet is really very messy (ie 2nd half of HeistMeisters, and 3D lessons), and a lot is achieved through hacks which would encourage bad practice for beginner programmers. The code quality and consistency of the re-done courses could still be improved, but having said that I still give it 5 stars because it's an excellent course, very well structured and to be honest still much better quality code (and very well prepared) than many from other game development courses. One more thing to mention is that it feels the 2nd 3D game has quite a lot of overlap from the first 3D and feels like for a lot of it there are not many new concepts learned, especially compared to how many new concepts are introduced as the 2D games progress - if these are re-done it would be great to see new more advanced concepts in the 2nd 3D course (maybe like adding a godot module, etc). Finally, the C# piece clearly is not in place so it woudl also be good to update the intro to remove that mention until it's complete, and tbh that could be a whole new course in itself instead of appending it to this one. Thanks Yann & Ben.",

  "body": "Overall, I'd say this course is a bit of a mixed bag. Whether or not it's helpful to you will depend very much on what experience you already have with Unity 2D development.\n\nI've never worked with Unity before, so I think it was a helpful tutorial for me because it seems like it started at the very beginning of game development in Unity. If you already know how to make a 2D game in Unity though, you probably won't get much out of this tutorial.\n\nPersonally, I selected this one specifically because I was interested in the aspects that are unique to Android development. But the majority of the course is just general game development. Android isn't even introduced until the very end of the course and there's not much to it. I would have liked to see more mobile topics covered, especially how to store data (settings, progess, etc) on Android devices and how to create a level progression screen.\n\nI'm not a fan of the course's format, particularly the \"challenges\". I've done many courses that have a challenge element to it, but this is the first course I've taken where the challenge is to use something that hasn't even been introduced yet in the course. Typically, they would show how to do it first and then introduce a challenge to do the same thing on your own. Instead, you are expected to Google the answers for the challenges, which is something that the teacher does in the videos himself.\n\nRepetition is a big problem in this course too. A large portion of the lessons is the same repeated easy task, like slicing sprites or creating animations. There's no value in repeatedly showing the process. Instead, it just seems like filler content to make the overall course length appear longer on the Udemy listing. I'd rather see a game with just 1 or 2 characters and more of the time used to learn new things.\n\nAnother big issue I have with this course is that the instructor has abandoned it, leaving the Q&A up to the Discord community. Fortunately, the existing Q&A content on the course was able to fix any problems that came up in the course. The problems weren't really on the instructor's side, it was just issues with stuff being updated and changed.\n\nLike I said, it's a mixed bag. I'd probably only recommend it to people who have never used Unity before or those who have an extremely small amount of experience. You definitely need a basic understanding of C# or a similar language. If I wasn't a completely new person to Unity myself, my rating would probably be dramatically lower than 3 stars. However, since I can't lie and say that I walked away with nothing from this course, I'll give it an average 3 stars. It definitely could have been better.",

It would've helped to have some sort of diagram or something to explain the mechanics and functions in a visual manner.\n\nAdditionally, I may not be the wiser, but I get the feeling that some of the methods the instructor uses are good coding practice, like using strings as identifiers, and there were many areas that I think could be taught with more efficient techniques (e.g. why not use Scriptable objects for the likes of the BattleMoves, BattleTypes, or even the CharacterStats?)\n\nBy far the worst part of the course was Section 105, where he leaves the students up to quite a difficult challenge. This would've been alright, if it weren't for the fact that he didn't provide a video with a solution (I know you can download the completed project at the end, but that doesn't really help explain the code). I just had to skip it so I could complete the course without wasting time.\n\nOverall, I did in fact learn a small handful of skills from this course that could help me make my own RPG, but I'm going to have to do a whole lot of tweaking to the code from here for it to be more flexible to my own ideas.",

This game has helped me achieve my childhood dream of creating my first video game character. I have dabbled in Blender for years but felt I lacked the right guidance to see a character design through. Not only was the curriculum well thought out, but the encouragement from these instructors was phenomenal. The small exercises thrown in were a terrific touch and really gave the student an opportunity to explore their own method for modeling/sculpting before following the technique of a skilled mentor. Thank you for helping me to fulfill a long sought after goal!",

  "body": "Overall I really enjoyed the course! For me it was a literal game changer when it comes to sculpting and modelling. Grant Abbitt did an amazing job highlighting the important aspects of each step. He's really confident in his skills and knows the ins and outs of Blender 2.8 and above very well. The instructions were very clear and comprehensive, entertaining and really enjoyable overall! The only minor nitpicks I have are related to the retopology and animation section of this course. These sections are very basic and only brushed upon. Grant gives a pretty good overview of what needs to be done but for the sake of the overall course these (very complicated sections) are stripped down to a bare minimum. (which in my opinion is totally understandable considering the sheer volume of information and experience needed to nail retopology and animation). The other nitpick I have is, that some (only a few!) videos were a little bit fast, but the great thing about the video content is that you can rewind whenever you need to. Really liked the course! I would highly recommend to take this course if you have a little experience with 3D Modelling software and want to up your skills quite a bit. I'd love to take courses, instructed by Grant Abbitt on the topics of retopology and animation in the future!",
