I was literally in the middle of the old one when the update came, but I gladly went through all of it again.\n\nThank you very much Colt for this extrordinary experience.",

Course cover various of web dev essentials such as html, css, javascript, nodejs, api , routes etc. Great support from the TA.\n\nHowever, the course is rather outdated and lots of technology is no longer support / use nowadays such as bootstrap 3 and jQuery, Javascript ES 5 only . Also lots of coding in backend and the tools are also out of date. It makes the TA keeps updating materials, new videos as a supplement to cover those parts and its a bit messy.\n\nI enjoy the course as Colt is really good at teaching. But I personally would not recommend this course simply because the outdated content. It is a course 5 years ago and I end up need to subscribe different courses to supplement those parts.\n\nI hope Colt and the team will revisit my comment and consider to update most of the content in the course include ES6 Javascript syntax, backend sessions etc.",

  "body": "Not as good as expected. Some of the materials are old and you get a feeling you´ll have to update yourself. The course needs a revamp to make it a 2020 course.\n\nThere are a lot of intermediate comments made by Colt´s assistant Ian that try to help but reflect the fact the course needs to be reviewed. I know that is a lot of work, but that would get you 5 star reviews.\n\nOn the other hand I feel disappointed with the fact that in the end, I wasn´t thought how to create my own website. The deployment part speaks briefly about how to deploy a project in Heroku. Nothing is said about what about if I already have my own website. Or if I want to create a new one. I wanted to learn coding to improve my business website. I have it in wordpress. I'm aware the backend language is php and I can use a control panel to manage it. Nothing in the course is said about this.\n\nSome of the contents are disconnected. At some point you'll be sent to Ian's youtube videos, then comes Ellie to speak about javascript more advanced issues, not announced.\n\nI got to the end and the YelpCamp project that was core to our learning through experience was incomplete. They give you a number of videos from youtube to try and give you the essentials. I only watched one by Ian on google maps, and it was so old I couldn´t follow wit the current Google API environment.\n\nThe promise I was given when I bought the course wasn´t delivered. This is not enough for me to create my own website or project.\n\nAll this said I also need to leave some comments of the positives of this course. First of all the Q&A team. I've asked a couple of things and responses were quick and helpful. On online environment that is very welcome.\n\nThe course is thorough. I think I now have the tools to go deeper into the different technologies and languages if I want.\n\nColt is very clear in his expositions. Some times speaks to quick for a foreigner like myself, but we have the magic of rewind to hear as many times as we wish.\n\nWith all considered this is probably, still one of the best and more complete courses online available on the subject. I feel tempted to search for others though.\n\nThere are many other positive aspects I haven´t focused on. All in all I think 3 stars is the rate applicable at this point in time.\n\nColt and team, please think about updating the materials, or even creating a new whole course.",

The slides beforehand are always nice - where it mentions the updated syntax, but having to follow through those videos with outdated syntax where we learned the updated syntax many many slides ago is just frustrating, confusing, and just plain annoying. This course was probably great 5 years ago, but these videos need to be updated properly for it to be truly effective. The few slides many moons ago, don't do this course any justice, and the fact that there are often so many things left out of the videos truly leaves me demotivated to finish the course. I always return to finish, but I can see these frustrations leaving many not wanting code again. Decent course for the price, Colt is a pretty good teacher and I would love to learn from him at one of his other bootcamps, but the material is lacking in 2020.",

The first half of the course that deals with frontend development is very comprehensive as Colt takes time to explain concepts.\n\nThe second half however left me a bit frustrated; the backend development felt more like bringing the puzzle pieces together rather than understanding the basic of puzzle. The course has given me a good idea of how node works, but I am unsatisfied with the approach taken: most of the time, when we included packages, it felt like we were doing so arbitrarily. On this front, there were too many minor things to take care of and remember; I am not sure if this is inherent to working with node, but it was left unclear.\n\nOverall, the course offers more than what I paid for it and I am happy with what I have learned from this course.\n\nThanks Colt!",

The final section \"where do you go from here\" could include some tips on setting up students own environment for doing web project on their own machines for practice purpose, which includes a webserver and required IDE.\n\nOverall, the course was great to follow and practice. Learnt a lot!!\n\nRegards, Tapan.",

Also, throughout the course, we built around 10 projects, in which we focused on the react and redux part, not on stylings, which I loved it since we had enough time to discuss all details of react and redux.

Also at many places reference to eBook has been made which has been missing. It has been answered that in place of eBook website URL has been provided. Could not find all things in the website that has been mentioned. Many referenced websites have changed the way of functioning and some of them don’t even exist now.

I would have saved myself \"weeks\", literal \"weeks\" worth of time at work (I am a full time web developer coding primarily in JS for a little over the past year) because the concepts discussed in this course are fundamental to debugging (production) code! I'm excited for the rest of this course.\n\nUPDATE: Halfway through the course, it's important to run some of the code in the console to see the differences in how JS works now as compared to when Anthony taught the course. Such a gem of a course, I love how it's focused on the bare bones of how JS works under the hood! Every serious JS programmer should attempt to learn the concepts in this course. Love it!",

I didn't go for five stars though because there are some areas that I thought were badly explained and I had to go elsewhere for a lot of information (particularly around what prototypes actually are and how promises actually work). Also, it seems that so much of JS is passing parameters into functions, and defining those parameters using arguments wherever that function is called. This distinction between parameters and arguments never actually gets explained on this course: you have to figure it out for yourself. The final two projects were EXTREMELY well explained, and it would have been great if the whole course was explained to this level. Overall though, I'm really happy with what I got out of it.",

Yeah a JavaScript course without a mention of closures.\n\nNo word about apply, bind or call functions.\n\nHe used filter function late in lecture 98 in a wrong manner which just by luck worked for the example he was working on. So cannot even expect the explanation there.\n\nIncomplete coverage of the the spread operator.\n\nFor...of loop (without any introduction) was used for the first time in the lecture on sets in section 10.\n\nIn the last section, he just tells to download the webpack+babel setup from his GitHub profile without explaining how he created it.\n\nThe list is too long.",

I tried other videos and online courses and to me, it seemed like they were made from the perspective that people had previous programming experience and wanted to learn how to program with Javascript. The focus was mainly on just how to write functions, arrays, and objects and not seeing any results of this outside of logging things on a console. These lessons for the first time showed me how JS can manipulate the DOM, methods for targeting HTML in a webpage, creating OOP, modules, patterns, and lots more so I finally could see what JS was doing when related to working on webpages for front-end work. The small projects are super helpful, and helped me to really understand the language while both coming together and in the final product. I will definitely be revisiting these videos for practice and test how much more I can do independently as I progress.",

Her lessons and course exercises are structured in such a way that it is easy to understand, without being too slow or too fast-paced to follow along with. She breaks down really complex concepts into simple, understandable chunks. As icing on the cake, her sense of humor is delightful!\n\nThis course not only demystifies Swift and XCode, but also teaches really important concepts like the Model/View/Controller pattern and Github. Good lord, THANK YOU Angela for including Git in this tutorial. It's ridiculous how many coding courses Ive taken with no mention of it at all.\n\nMy only problems with this course are that sometimes the audio cuts and repeats, or sometimes she dives into using a concept that she has not yet explained and then goes back to explain it in a later lesson. ALSO- I would recommend grabbing the latest version of the course for iOS 13 if you can, because some things are out of date in this course.\n\nOther than that, I have no complaints. Angela is truly awesome and if you have the discipline to get through the course, you will learn a ton even in the first 20 hours. My only other wish is that there would be some bonus lectures on NFC encoding but I can understand why its omitted since you need an iPhone X or later plus NFC cards/wristbands to read and write NFC with an app.",

  "body": "I wish to provide 5 star but this course doesn't cover all the API and components of React-Native. Flatlist is the component has been used entirely in this course instead might have applied all other Components at least one place. Also, widely using API is not covered in this course like SMS, audio and video recording and accessing device details through PHONE_STATE is missing. Important missing piece is React-Native CLI developing. This major concept is covered at single video where should have spent at least a section. I have learned most of the concepts of React-Native and will expect that above limitations will be added into course. Thank You Max.",

  "body": "Many thanks for a very interesting course. One really learns a lot. Unfortunately, a few things are no longer up to date - but this has the advantage that you get more involved with the topic. From my point of view 2 aspects are not well solved. The TaskTimer app is very complex. It would have been better to teach some concepts in smaller projects. Furthermore, the TaskTimer App was not programmed completely. The chapter for settings is missing. Nevertheless, anyone who wants to learn programming should take a look at this course. Some programming experience would be helpful.",

But with \"but\"s.\n\n+ The content of this course is VERY big, valuable, lots of useful techniques, unobvious approaches, Android lifehacks and design tricks.\n\n+ Jean-Paul usually replies questions very fast and this is a great support!\n\n+ Tim speaks on video with optimal speed: many lecturers speek too slow and make course too long, not in this case. This means, more information is packed in these 60 hours of lectures.\n\n- MANY times I was like, \"what`s going on?\" because the explanation style is: \"coding on screen, telling what the code does\". This is master class, yes, not a definitive course of lectures, but more visual material (e.g. illustrating how different parts of Android ecosystem work) would be of great help. Tables with app structure helped a lot, but there are just a few of them.\n\n- Course has a cliffhanger \"we will make app settings in the next video\" and there`s no next video, it is the end of the course. (as of 31.07.2020). I hope it will be finished.\n\nConclusion: I would recommend this course to any person who is gonna be Android developer, though not as a first, \"introduction\" course.",

  "body": "This is more a course about how to do android app in the worst possible way.\n\n- The code is horrible. The author creates methods and attributes as needed, without following any order structure.\n\n- Kotlin? Half. Use kotlin to program and it works. But it constantly uses expressions that it shouldn't use. For example, he uses the second constructor instead of the main one, he is constantly using !! to avoid checking nulls, he doesn't use data classes either ... it's one after another\n\n- Some apps don't even finish them, because they get so confusing that even he doesn't seem to know how to go on. Like the TicTacToe example.\n\n- Many applications do not work, for example the alarm. Or anyone that involves using external services (weather application, Maps application ...)\n\n- He does not answer questions or have someone to answer them. Basically you have access to these videos and code, but nothing else.\n\nI am disappointed with the course.",

  "body": "ating: 1.0 out of 5\n2 months ago\n\nI want to start by saying I have always been good at analytical thought processing. I was always good at math, so while I'm new to programming it's not something I find to be inherently difficult or abstract. Also, I have gotten through most of this course already so it's not like I started a few videos, didn't like them, and quit. I've been pushing through and intend to finish the course but at this point I can see that certain things are not going to change towards the end.\n\nThe structure of this course is just horrible. Apparently they are working on a revision which I believe should help to some degree as it became blatantly obvious when I got past the revised portion and into the original course material.\n\nThe first problem I have with the structure is that there is very little thought put into prioritization. It seems like there is just as much time and emphasis put on things that are trivial as there is on the core concepts that you are trying to learn. For instance, he literally spends about 1.5 hours on time zones. If I want to become an expert on time zones I can look that up on my own time. I'm trying to learn programming here, sure time zones are a valuable thing to know how to implement, but they are hardly essential to the main goal of learning how to program.\n\nSecond, there is not very much drilling of core concepts. There are really no big projects that help you to put what you learn into practice. Other courses I've taken in Javascript, HTML/CSS, have had projects along the way so you get comfortable with what you've learned so far before moving on.\n\nThird, this seems like almost as much of a trouble shooting class as a teaching class. I understand that trouble shooting is VERY important in programming. However, the lessons are so often interrupted with trouble shooting tips that you kind of lose focus on the main reason most people take the class, learning to do things correctly. This is probably a feature that may be beneficial to people who are intermediate Python programmers, but for those of us who are beginners as the course advertises it is meant for, the trouble shooting really can be distracting from just learning the correct ways of doing things. Might be beneficial to have a separate trouble shooting section at the end of the course instead of constantly interrupting the study flow of students showing them how to deal with this and that along the way that really shouldn't be happening if they are writing their code correctly. Usually this occurs in the middle of a video, but sometimes is just inserted into a section as a random separate video that is not necessarily just applicable to that sections material. For instance, halfway through the SQL/Database section we just stop and get into 1.5 hours worth of videos about exception handling. I get that exception handling is applicable to SQL/databases, but it is far from being exclusively applicable to that area of Python, so why stop in the middle of SQL/databases, why not just add it in it's own section or at least at the beginning or end of the database section instead of stopping right in the middle?\n\nFourth, trial and error. I get that programming entails a lot of trial and error, however, when you're new at something you'll make enough typos and other errors all on your own. These videos were made seemingly with little prior plan for how goals would be achieved. The instructor seems to be processing how he's going to do things as he does them. This leads to students sometimes being told to type code that doesn't execute correctly and then having to adjust it along with the instructor after they've already spent time typing a bunch of stuff out. Also a lot of things that may not necessarily cause code not to execute but that the instructor tells you to do it one way and then halfway through just realizes that the way he had done it is not the best way to do it and has you change it.\n\nFifth, similar names. Throughout the course the instructor will use a similar names for multiple things in a video or even the same name with the only difference being one start with a capitalized letter and one without or one is plural and one is not, etc etc. This makes in difficult to follow what is supposed to be going where as you're writing code. Am I referring to a class or a variable? etc, etc. It also makes it less obvious what previously written code is referring to as you're watching the video, is this code referring back to the Class, to a variable, to a function? May seem obvious to an intermediate student but to a beginner it makes the learning process more difficult. It also makes it unnecessarily difficult to catch errors when your code doesn't execute properly.\n\nFinally, too much going on in a single video. To be fair, this does seem to be something they are addressing in the up coming revised version. But very often in this course you will be working on a concept, you'll learn how to do it, and then rather than leaving that video finished and having that in your mind as to how that concept/process should be done, he'll continue the video and have you erase what you've done to show you another way of doing it, and then another way of doing it, and then another way of doing it. By the end you're kind of like \"what the hell was I supposed to be learning to begin with?\". Probably better to just start a new video, create a new file, copy the code from the other file, and then change it to learn another variation of how to do something. It would help with keeping different concepts/processes separate in your mind.\n\nOverall I think this course is difficult and frustrating for a beginner to follow. I would imagine that it would not be as difficult for an intermediate student to follow, but might still be just as frustrating.",

This course really get your hands dirty. It's a real learning by practicing course and not simply syntax learning.\n\nI also like instructor's manner. He is quite funny and easy to listen to. You will see many errors happening here and there in this course. Personally, I think it's not a bad thing because you see how to fix it (or google) and be familiar with the exceptions which is part of programming job..fixing bugs or try out solutions.\n\nLast but not the least is Q&A support, I would say it's second to none. Course Assistant is super supportive and respond in short time. He does pay attention to help and give advices to students.\n\nThank you Ardit for such a big amazing course and David for your kind support to students.\n\nI look forward for The Python Mega Course: Season2!",

While this is valid coding, it can be very confusing.\n\nSecond, he should really go back and fix the quizzes. These should be 100% accurate and they aren't. I stopped doing them because I was getting marked wrong on answers that turned out to be correct which added more confusion.\n\nTo repeat, I have purchased and gone through a couple of the other beginning C# courses and this is by far the best and definitely well enough put together to learn the material.",

I definitely learned a lot, going over all basic and not so basic concepts in Python programming, including Data Science and Machine Learning (the most exciting part for me), among other interesting and useful subjects. All the famous and most popular libraries, IDEs, and Flask framework, are included in the course. The course also leads you to an amazing and supportive Discord community, where you can discuss your code, share your progress, find help and coding buddies. They have also Github community, where you can work with others or on your own on open source projects and maybe share these contributions on your resume. I'll be coming back to this course to complete the 100 Python exercises.\n\nThanks very much Andrei for this course! You're saying it's important for you to provide value to others and to the world. I think that you've definitely achieved that via your courses and community! It's a great benefit for the world to have you existing! :)\n\nAlso, special thanks to the teaching assistant William, who was all the time with me throughout my journey with this course and always helped me out, whenever I was stuck with difficult, or silly situations, and took the time to clarify for me concepts, which I had troubles with at first!\n\nI can't really describe all the amazing features of this course in such a review, but there are many more. Keep up the good work, guys!",

Please expand Machine Learning and cover more concepts. 4) Please add Pytest(under Automation Testing section), Python with nonsql database, Python GUI programming(basics), Python Concurrency and Threads, Python linear and non-linear data structures, Python for Parallel and distributed computing, Python Stream Processing. The course rating is 4 b/c nothing is said about how to do python app with sql database and rest api should be discussed in much more detail. The overall Python course is very good - above average.",

  "body": "I work as a solutions developer in an IT firm with 2 yrs exp. I am not much of an easily-convinced person, but its safe to say that Andrei is the best instructor till now that I have come across on the internet..and mind that I have taken a lot of online courses from various sources!! Its not very common to expect Lehman-level teaching, right from basics, to accommodate both pro-to newbie students with zero coding/computing background, from a senior dev turned instructor. The best part is that he shares his way of thinking and working around with syntaxes and topics etc, and how to figure out solutions from internet and what should be the approach. Personally, I find this part one of the most overwhelming while developing stuff. Now, about the course-- The course syllabus is quite comprehensive, including well-explained Dev env setup videos and tools. Both Andrei and his videos literally walk through every bit of setting up env, along with discussing bits which may be encountered in case of other versions/OS/softwares. The course content is well-distributed into sections, with well-timed videos of short durations, which ends before it starts to go over the top of the head! William, the teaching assistant was quite helpful too, in promptly answering all queries wherever one gets stuck, in very less time. Finally, it was a great course to start learning Python and go on to specialize in it. I had some experience with learning web-dev online earlier but left it midway because it was too vast and was getting too much to understand and master. Now with this course having done, I feel much more interested and confident in taking a web-development or Front-end dev course. Thanks Andrei...looking forward to more of your courses !!!!",

I personally liked the approach taken by you throughout the course including the course pattern, Building the entire module along with you was a great learning experience for me. I was so engaged into it and excited about learning stuffs for almost last 4 weeks that made me confident enough and gave a better developer experience. It covered everything from scratch to advanced topics, not to forget deployment and then the TypeScript + Deno part was a real dessert.\n\nI had also enrolled for the React course and shall soon dive into it.. Looking forward to more content.\n\nThanks & Regards.",

  "body": "This course is not what I expected at all. Yes, Max does in fact cover all the necessary topics that he says that he will cover, but when it came to getting unstuck it was hard not to be disastisfied with the lack of answers provided by the teaching assistants. There are also problems that prior students pointed out 2-3 years ago that were NEVER corrected in the module. So you have students in 2020 still running into issues that students in 2017 told Max and Adam to update years ago. While the TA is why I paid for the course(just the ability to get some feedback), responses to problems were pretty much consistent, \"use my source code\", \"have you compared your source code to my code\" and was no really help at all. I stopped coding a month ago because I was stuck on an issue that I couldn't solve in the lecture, I came back and see that new tickets have been added to the Q&A resource tab - looks like this problem has STILL not been resolved. You even have prior students telling Max and Adam that the module should be updated to reflect the answers they have found after hours and hours of extensive troubleshooting. So there are sections where students can easily be guided but no guidance has been provided. But I guess we should all be thankful that DenoJS has just been added to the course. How about fixing the bugs/really taking a look at what students are having issues/reteaching some of the areas that are problematic and then focus on pushing out new content? It must be a slap in the face for students to spend hours and hours of debugging and coming up with solutions only for Max to add new content, but never address the bugs and problems in the module or the code. I also didn't like the constant refactoring. If I was stuck in one section, it made it harder to determine where the problem was because Max had already started on a new topic in A NEW SECTION. The course comes out super disorganized, and I cannot image that I put in wayyyy too much time into this course thinking that it was going to change somehow. The amount of hours that's needed in the course doesn't make sense when it can be taught rather simply and straightforward. There were also some sections that a quick Google search provided clear and succint answers to that Max explained in a rather difficult way.",

Having completed the earlier R Programming courses from Kirill Eremenko, I obtained a fairly basic handle on the core R language (having no experience beforehand), and felt ML would be a good next challenge. I committed to complete the entire course - which is quite comprehensive - and I'm quite glad I did as I now feel as if I have enough of a handle on building up these models and can at least speak intelligently about them. The coding skills of Hadelin de Ponteves are quite impressive and there were many little tricks and takeaways that can be applied elsewhere in your work. I do have one important complaint and that is regarding working with the H2o platform in the ANN lecture. There are many, many complaints on this topic which have not been addressed by the author(s). I came to the solution after much research and it involves installing a compatible version of Java JDK on your machine. The documentation is found on the H2o website. As of today, H2o does not support the most recent version of Java (15) so you will need to download an earlier version from the Java archive. Installing/uninstalling is a bit of a pain, but good luck.",

I purchased a course so that I could receive multimedia instruction, which should be the best method to learn from. However, you end up being directed to many third party websites or books if you want any depth of understanding. Most of the ML part of the course is simply learning what to type into a Jupyter Notebook in order to get a very basic ML algorithm to run. The Big Data and Spark w/ Python section is a complete disaster. As far as I could ascertain, there was no attempt to show how to tie Spark into an ML project. I came away not even knowing how to utilize Spark for an ML project. Also that section is outdated, and once again you are directed to another website for \"up-to-date\" instructions on how to install Spark on AWS. Unfortunately, those instructions were outdated too. I couldn't even get Spark to run the action methods on my AWS E2C service. It was a complete waste of time. Overall, the course is just ok. The instructor seems knowledgeable, and very courteous. Nevertheless, I am leaving an honestly review in hopes that he sees what to improve, and so that others honestly know what to expect. It is not a waste of time or money, but I was expecting more. The instructor's Python Boot Camp course was awesome, and that is what set the expectation for me. Unfortunately, this course did not live up to expectations.",

  "body": "I was almost a beginner in Python, however the gradual approach adopted for the topics presentation permitted me to properly learn some fundamental tools of Python. The approach to machine learning section is gradual as well, providing the necessary theoretichal tool to study and go deep into the math beyond the algorithm and the lybraries explained. The course mantains an application-focused and practical approch, consenting to immediately understand how to apply the presented tools. The final projects at each session allow to immediatly practice and test yourself, also providing the opportunity to build a small personal portfolio. It definitly worth the price I paid, for both the quality of the contents and the supporting service. Definitely reccommended to beginner and intermediate Python users who want to learn Machine Learning. This course will not automatically convert you into a Data Scientist. However, it definitly helps to construct solid practical basis to start from to become a Data Scientist.",

I think the course does an ok job covering the scikit-learn package; however, there's a ton of content in this package that could be expanded both covering supervised and unsupervised problems. Linear, logistic, and kmeans were a good first start; however, I would recommend expanding on other classifiers such as knn, SVMs and decision trees. On the plus side, it was great to cover neural networks with TF2 and Keras. Overall, I'm very pleased with this course as it triggered my interest in learning more and for sure gave me the confidence in having a solid foundation on which I can continue to build upon. The exercises were also very informative and detailed and will help me on my journey to develop skillsets around data analytics.",

  "body": "So I just finished this course today. The lecture contents was long and exhaustive. I can tell the instructors had put in a lot of efforts and time to make the lectures interesting. The total hours for this course is 29 hours, and i think it took me like 60 hours due to stopping, replaying, stopping again, and taking notes etc. Overall, I think they could have done better. Some suggestions I think this course could improve on:\n\n1. python - when you introduce the codes there should have been some markups with arrows and bullet points stating what that code does and when you run the code show us with markings what it does. Most of the time the instructor will get overly excited when he runs the code and not explaining what's going on. Also when you add a code, to add some columns show us where it will end up and mark them on the videos. More bullet point notes the better. Sometimes you introduce new codes and don't exactly explain what it does and it gets so confusing. And you also copy and paste codes from somewhere and expect us to understand what you did as it went over my head. Because this Python part is so important to all of us learning for the first time, and eventually we'll get into Data Science in our careers one day, this section needs to be improved on so we all can better understand what's going on.\n\n2. TF1 vs TF2 - I don't think there's any need to go comparing both of these as TF2 is current and mostly what we are trying to learn now right? Also getting TF2 to install was a nightmare as some people had the same issue.\n\n3. Intro. to the field of Data Science - These lectures are way too long. You have 8 sections describing this and could have sum up in a few lectures stating what it does and the types of careers one can go into with the type of skill sets. Sorry but I was about to fall asleep.\n\n4. Mathematics - Maybe need to add basic Calculus\n\n5. Probability and Stats - it was long but alright.\n\n6. Other items to add - SQL and Big Data, just the basic stuffs and how to integrate these into Python, and discuss what software we'll need to learn etc.\n\n7. Lecture Videos - Quality could be better as the video seems a bit blurry or low quality.\n\n8. Instructors - As most students stated that the instructors voice sounded like a robot and not a real human teaching and I totally agree. I won't drill into too much but I find the instructor who was teaching the Case Study for the Absenteeism (Preprocessing) does a good job as he uses markups to indicate how the code was executed and carried out.\n\nI did enjoyed it and learned some skills along the way. Thanks.",

  "body": "SUPER GREAT COURSE! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nHi 365 DataScience Team,\n\nI was recommended this course by a friend of mine, who is a great expert in Data Science. I just wanT to say I am tremendously happy with this course. I can't tell you how much I love it. Indeed, I love the course as much as I do the two very talented teachers/Professors Martin and Iliya. Let me take this opportunity to clarify the reasons for my great enjoyment of the course:\n\n1. First, the content is very easy to understand.\n\n2. Realistic approach, balanced theories and practice\n\n3. Extremely eye-catching design and presentation. I mean the way the content is delivered on the screen is very attractive.\n\n4. Martin and Iliya are ACTUALLY TEACHING, not just repeating what is on the screen as some other teachers do. They usually flux the screen with tons of words, and just read what is there, which is both boring and does not make much sense.\n\n5. Great and timely response in the Q&A section of the course, which is very helpful, especially to novice learners like me.\n\n6. The course has been continuously updated since its appearance on Udemy, which shows that Martin and Iliya do care about the quality of their work.\n\nThe list may go on and on. However, the most AMAZING thing to me (and I do believe it is also amazing to other learners) is the VOICE!!! Both teachers have a voice so amazing, clear, and energetic that I could hardly get bored with the lesson. By the way, I love your proper pronunciation and intonation so much, which helps learners to understand the lesson a great deal.\n\nAll in all, this is the best course I have ever learned online, and Martin and Iliya are two of the most wonderful teachers/instructors/Professors in the field I've ever known.\n\nI hope Martin and Iliya have a chance to read this review as well.\n\nPlease make more and more such courses for us, Matin and Iliya!\n\nWish you all the best!\n\nDanh Nguyen",

I am hoping to get R plots to work in Power BI at the end of this course. I love it.\n\nThank you.",

One thing, however, that was nagging at me throughout the entirety of the course was whether I had the proper preparation. This course is listed as the first of the AI Engineer path on the SuperDataScience website. Therefore, I thought it would be the most appropriate course with which to begin, but the course may not be self-contained. There are many areas during which the instructors refer to another course (e.g., Machine Learning A-Z) and that worried me as to whether I should've taken it before starting this one. Nonetheless, I followed through pretty well, and you should too if you have previous experience in Python.\n\nOne thing I would advise the instructors to do is to keep these courses as self-contained as possible and not even mention materials from other courses if there are no prerequisites. That or simply include the necessary modules in the Annex.",

There is room for improvement in explaining certain concepts as to Why, When, and How are they used. While explaining a few code constructs, I noticed the same could be done in 10 other ways but it wasn't clearly conveyed as to why a particular logic is chosen over the other. Overall, I do appreciate the attempt by your team to make things as simple as possible and I expect your team to come up with an even deeper explanation of concepts and code alike.",

Quickly get's you tinkering and accomplishing small tasks.\n\nComing from an engineering background, I felt I had to do a bit more digging using supplemental material to understand the more 'magic' sections (e.g. SVM), but no big deal as those are details that can be delayed for later once one has a broad overview of the field. Also don't worry too much about not getting the math.\n\nEnjoyed how the final project brought together a lot of the concepts.\n\nI'm now at a good place to solidify a lot of the concepts using practice projects.",

In terms of suggestions for improving the course further, here are a couple of areas for suggested inclusion:\n\n- model explainability for scenarios where dimensionality reduction is utilised (e.g. PCA) or emergent behaviour is observed (e.g. deep learning). This is because explaining how a model arrived at a particular prediction is a critical topic for gaining business confidence from a product owner/business stakeholder.\n\n- when multiple models are feasible to address a business problem, which considerations determine model selection (unless the recommendation is to try all feasible models and use the model that provides the best results, similar to the final project's approach).\n\n- model drift, the factors that cause it, and how to address it (e.g. model retraining)\n\nAs a suggestion for an advanced follow-up course, it'd be great to be able to explore the underlying mathematical theory of the machine/deep learning algorithms explored in this course. This is something I haven't yet seen elsewhere on Udemy, except for regression models.\n\nA separate more Deep Learning course would also be beneficial for exploring topics such as how different gradient descent optimisation algorithms work and considerations for when each kind of algorithm should be used.",

  "body": "This is a good course. The theory part is especially very good and the tutor exactly knows what he is doing. The first AI, to build the self-driving car, was quite a difficult one to start with, considering no experience in the field. But eventually, you'll get along. The second one, Doom, was absolutely awesome and that is the one I enjoyed the most. That feeling when I saw my AI beat Doom is unexplainable :D. The third one, Breakout, is way too difficult, even the tutor mentioned that it is a bonus.\n\nOne feedback I'd like to give is that u could include a small intro to Pytorch and the functions of the same used to make the AIs in the course. Since this course has no requirements (but actually requires knowing PyTorch basics), the above could have been included.\n\nAnd explaining the structure of the AI beforehand dramatically before moving on to coding can make the coding part more intuitive, especially when starting off and not having any idea of what's ahead.\n\nAnd this course has a good support team. Never had to wait for more than a day for a reply. There are many topics that more than 20 people are equally doubtful about, so rather than asking the same question again and replying for the same, I'd recommend including the same in the course.\n\nNevertheless, the course was good overall. I took this course as a starter, and now I know the key areas I have to focus on to get a strong foundation in the field. And can boast about making an AI beat Doom. :D",

It will give you the right intuition and kickstart about understanding and working of AI but it won't make you confident enough on using or building your own AI. It has really good in detail theory part but implementation could have made simpler and easy. At some points so many concepts come up and you just lose interest and try to pace up with the code without understanding what's actually happening. I will consider it as more of a guide than a course to learn AI. But instructor has actually put a lot of efforts that can be seen. Secondly in Doom game project, if you're running windows 10 then probably either you have to go for a dual boot or use a virtual machine to run your training model which is something I actually don't like... There should have been something which should be compatible with all kinds or not if all atleast (Windows+Mac+Linux) OS. Thank you very much for this course!",

Not that quantity of learning hours matters, but the extra efforts could be directed towards, say building industrial quality NLP applications (using spaCy).",

  "body": "This is a nice course and it brings up grounded approaches and good practices.\n\nWhat it lacks is depth and practical usage.\n\nFor the first, as an example you can easily get multiple times into notation that neural networks of course are better in all parameters than what is being studied here, but you go ahead study it yourself or purchase one more course from the author ))). Sometimes it is even funny\n\nAs for the practical usage, it is nice to put hands on deep learning libraries interface, but it would be much nicer to really build couple of applications that perform the real world action. To start with some model, to improve results by changing model and/or approach, to achieve really good scores and make something working. Here you basically make some that works normal at most, stop at the model selection level and get recommendation to improve it somehow yourself. Ok, not problem. But maybe there should be some benchmarking from author? Maybe exercises shall not be at the beginning, like now \"Code everything yourself after theoretical part, you shall do that\", but after practical part, like \"Now your got your hands on code, so make it better in this and this way and we see later how you performed\"\n\nAlso, it is annoying when source code is updated, but video is not. So when you try to code with author you almost always run into simple errors just because a lot of stuff has changed since than, I mean the sintax. So, the options are to spend time checking libraries' docs to fix the error or to look the source code, which is not nice.",
